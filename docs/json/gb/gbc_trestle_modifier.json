I use it in loads\n    of my projects. There are a couple of things that kind of tick me off though;\n    Trestle resources tend to become large files in the app/admin folder due to the\n    way they are written. I find it hard to read/maintain them as a big file, so I \n    split them up into smaller files and created a generator to ensure that they \n    always follow a standard. Another pet peeve is the menu handling. Handling menu itmes\n    in each resource quickly becomes a nightmare. Ordering them requires a lot of \n    manual work. To keep things simpler, inspired by the work from the crowd at WinterCMS,\n    I created a menu.yml file that is used to manage the menu. I also created a helper that\n    simplifies the placing of the menu. \n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/GregoryBrownConsultancy/gbc_trestle_modifier","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/GregoryBrownConsultancy/gbc_trestle_modifier","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"51cb8242ea0b5478eed750699ddecde263805c303a4abc9c8a623dc25fe0b16a","spec_sha":"b3558790bfd45b99f4c6d9d6add785342f5154c70bd26b2440a63fb99d0c449d","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/gbc_trestle_modifier","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/gbc_trestle_modifier-0.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/GregoryBrownConsultancy/gbc_trestle_modifier","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/GregoryBrownConsultancy/gbc_trestle_modifier","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"trestle","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/GregoryBrownConsultancy/gbc_trestle_modifier"}
