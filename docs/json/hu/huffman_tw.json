Using the exact code of the teeworlds codebase.\n  https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp\n\n  So this gem is ideal for developing teeworlds projects in ruby. But this is not a general purpose compression library.\n  Do not expect speed/ease of use/safety/correctness but just being as close to the teeworlds implementation as possible.\n","licenses":["Unlicense"],"metadata":{"rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"d582d4cb96adbe809ebeb5a4c8adc354ac0679b4cde19a33f9f50e44b4826faf","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/huffman_tw","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/huffman_tw-0.0.4.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ChillerDragon/huffman-tw","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/huffman_tw/0.0.4","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"rice","requirements":"~> 4.0.4"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/ChillerDragon/huffman-tw"}
