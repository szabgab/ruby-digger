What does that mean? Only you know!\n- Use vectors instead of inbuilt numbers in most situtations with no difference in behavior. Or, use familiar methods from numerics with sane semantics!\n- Enumerate vectors in a hash-like fashion, or transform to an array or hash as needed.\n- Enjoy a mix of vector-, complex- and polynomial-like behavior at appropriate times.\n- No dependencies, no extensions. It just works!\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.4.3/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.3","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.4.3","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"770413f32fcf67def5038465d1d2f5dfefe07198b3b4ae8c5162fe5e3bfec3cb","spec_sha":"0643b07be71b797772dbe77a79f6662481d39c5579d0cfce6bd0c527c0ea22b6","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number-0.4.3.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.4.3","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.3","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.4.3/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.3"}
