What does that mean? Only you know!\n* Use vectors instead of inbuilt numbers in most situtations with no difference in behavior. Or, use familiar methods from numerics with sane semantics!\n* Enumerate vectors in a hash-like fashion, or transform to an array or hash as needed.\n* Enjoy a mix of vector-, complex- and polynomial-like behavior at appropriate times.\n* No dependencies, no extensions. It just works!\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.6.1/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.6.1","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.6.1","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"d2cee5b5cc272dcacf9970534f3eff2dde130efb03ebb98c735315562c554c26","spec_sha":"67c5001e0fb4fce56d7144b150bdfb0e41b2791c0d56a7db83bff243ffd00220","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number-0.6.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.6.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.6.1","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.6.1/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.6.1"}
