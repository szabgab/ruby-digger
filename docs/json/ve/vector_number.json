What does that mean? Only you know!\n- Use vectors instead of inbuilt numbers in most situtations with no difference in behavior. Or, use familiar methods from numerics with sane semantics!\n- Enumerate vectors in a hash-like fashion, or transform to an array or hash as needed.\n- Enjoy a mix of vector-, complex- and polynomial-like behavior at appropriate times.\n- No dependencies, no extensions. It just works!\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.5.0/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.5.0","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.5.0","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"3cba4c118e22a33c2fbcaaf001506c13e0407f39a45fd171ba11f3043db0d093","spec_sha":"17e027f1dd298b018c1cb30e17aac3e732dee824697096a7e0538bfafcdad0c7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number-0.5.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.5.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.5.0","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.5.0/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.5.0"}
