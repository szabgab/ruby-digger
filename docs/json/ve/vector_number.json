What does that mean? Only you know!\n- Use vectors instead of inbuilt numbers in most situtations with no difference in behavior. Or, use familiar methods from numerics with sane semantics!\n- Enumerate vectors in a hash-like fashion, or transform to an array or hash as needed.\n- Enjoy a mix of vector-, complex- and polynomial-like behavior at appropriate times.\n- No dependencies, no extensions. It just works!\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.4.2/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.2","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.4.2","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"27449aec81338755653443f7d41ebd70d4bad3b727c37a60db9c150dab658b4e","spec_sha":"bd541a01683f3c9aa35d20d559f16fdcd7584d8759c4239b8da373c5d75af98a","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/vector_number-0.4.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/vector_number/0.4.2","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.2","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/blob/v0.4.2/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/trinistr/vector_number/tree/v0.4.2"}
