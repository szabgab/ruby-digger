You can make and use your own decorators, and you can also use some of the built-in ones that the gem provides. _Decorating_ methods is as simple as slapping a `decorate :some_decorator` above your method definition. _Defining_ decorators can be as simple as defining a method that yields to a block, or as complex as manipulating the decorated method's receiver and arguments, and/or changing the functionality of the decorator based on custom options supplied to it when initially applying the decorator.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"1f8bcbf5f5dfb0d8eda3fb6b7d021ce9e1af790864a869ec3b6178c07eacdf8e","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/adornable","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/adornable-1.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/kjleitz/adornable","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/adornable/1.3.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/kjleitz/adornable"}
