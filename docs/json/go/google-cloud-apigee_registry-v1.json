These descriptions include API specifications in standard formats like OpenAPI, the Google API Discovery Service Format, and the Protocol Buffers Language. These API specifications can be used by tools like linters, browsers, documentation generators, test runners, proxies, and API client and server generators. The Registry API itself can be seen as a machine-readable enterprise API catalog designed to back online directories, portals, and workflow managers. Note that google-cloud-apigee_registry-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-apigee_registry instead.
