A `Replay` is a type of simulation that lets you see how your members' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM policy. During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your members' access might change under the proposed policy. Note that google-cloud-policy_simulator-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-policy_simulator instead.
