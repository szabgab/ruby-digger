It attributes that information to the application's source code, helping you identify the parts of the application consuming the most resources, and otherwise illuminating the performance characteristics of the code. Note that google-cloud-profiler-v2 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-profiler instead.
