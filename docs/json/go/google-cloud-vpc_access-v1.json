This connection makes it possible for your serverless environment to access Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore instances, and any other resources with an internal IP address. Note that google-cloud-vpc_access-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-vpc_access instead.
