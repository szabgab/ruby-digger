If you use Apigee Connect, you do not need to configure the MART ingress gateway with a host alias and an authorized DNS certificate. Note that google-cloud-apigee_connect-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-apigee_connect instead.
