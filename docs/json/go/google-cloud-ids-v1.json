Cloud IDS works by creating a Google-managed peered network with mirrored VMs. Traffic in the peered network is mirrored, and then inspected by Palo Alto Networks threat protection technologies to provide advanced threat detection. You can mirror all traffic or you can mirror filtered traffic, based on protocol, IP address range, or ingress and egress. Note that google-cloud-ids-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-ids instead. See the readme for more details.","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"ba6207af1e286b67302c6cd219215f64809e99f765adb76f4cc4db0682de6fae","spec_sha":"8d2cb8979a2021f3e06dbe4e98519315d888becfcb9d159d636a15c19b848756","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/google-cloud-ids-v1","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/google-cloud-ids-v1-2.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/google-cloud-ids-v1/2.3.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"gapic-common","requirements":"~> 1.2"},{"name":"google-cloud-errors","requirements":"~> 1.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby"}
