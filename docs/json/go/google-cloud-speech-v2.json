The API recognizes more than 120 languages and variants to support your global user base. You can enable voice command-and-control, transcribe audio from call centers, and more. It can process real-time streaming or prerecorded audio, using Google's machine learning technology. Note that google-cloud-speech-v2 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-speech instead.
