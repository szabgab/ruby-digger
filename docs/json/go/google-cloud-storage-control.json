Buckets share a single global namespace, and each bucket belongs to a specific project that has an associated owner that pays for the data stored in the bucket. This API is accessed using standard gRPC requests.","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"53c7705a35933d07ffecffbad16f277286a17a27fa361a4508d053138acc71e9","spec_sha":"37732fb63e9da94d38463c3c37be9f380fa46c7c891390e26175dd1f658646c9","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/google-cloud-storage-control","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/google-cloud-storage-control-1.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/google-cloud-storage-control/1.2.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"google-cloud-core","requirements":"~> 1.6"},{"name":"google-cloud-storage-control-v2","requirements":">= 0.0, < 2.a"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby"}
