Clients consume your REST APIS to implement standalone apps for a mobile device or tablet, through apps running in a browser, or through any other type of app that can make a request to an HTTP endpoint. Note that google-cloud-api_gateway-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-api_gateway instead.
