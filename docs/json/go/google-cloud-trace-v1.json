This API provides low-level interfaces for interacting directly with the feature. For some languages, you can use OpenTelemetry, a set of open source tracing and stats instrumentation libraries that work with multiple backends. Note that google-cloud-trace-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-trace instead.
