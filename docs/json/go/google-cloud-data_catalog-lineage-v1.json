Lineage is used to track data flows between assets over time. You can create Lineage Events to record lineage between multiple sources and a single target, for example, when table data is based on data from multiple tables. Note that google-cloud-data_catalog-lineage-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-data_catalog-lineage instead.
