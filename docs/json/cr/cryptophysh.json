{"gems":{"name":"cryptophysh","downloads":29,"version":"1.0.0","version_created_at":"2024-07-11T10:57:48.174Z","version_downloads":0,"platform":"ruby","authors":"Kryptyk Physh","info":"# Cryptophysh\n\nMy attempt to produce a solution to the requirements listed [here](https://github.com/krystal/code-tasks/blob/main/password-generator.md). Essentially, a library/gem you can include in to your own code to add a `::generate_password` class method on a class.\n\nI've pushed the built gem up to RubyGems for completeness' sake.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:\n\n    $ bundle add cryptophysh\n\nIf bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:\n\n    $ gem install cryptophysh\n\n## Usage\n\n### Extending your own class\n\n`require cryptophysh` and\n\nAdd to your class: `extend Cryptophysh`\n\nYour class will now have access to the `::generate_password` class method.\n\n### Using the Cryptophysh::PasswordGenerator Class\n\nSee the YARD documentation on the class itself for details.\n\n## Development\n\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\n\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/cryptophysh.
