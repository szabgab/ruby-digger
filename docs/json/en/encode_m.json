Build hierarchical database keys like M(\"users\", 42, \"email\") that sort correctly as raw bytes. This 40-year production-tested algorithm from YottaDB/GT.M powers Epic (70% of US hospitals) and VistA. Perfect for B-tree indexes, key-value stores, and any system requiring sortable hierarchical keys. All types maintain correct ordering when compared as byte strings - no decoding needed.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/encode_m"},"yanked":false,"sha":"63532f10a66cc5009041e1e7917b73f281c5e3759c6c185502206b86eae93ba9","spec_sha":"841c769aaca794da8f06b484b7565b1c0ad20665f84a1dc900584a702b2b751d","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/encode_m","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/encode_m-3.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/encode_m","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"benchmark-ips","requirements":"~> 2.10"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"minitest-reporters","requirements":"~> 1.6"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/shreeve/encode_m"}
