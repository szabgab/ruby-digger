Use convenient domain names without ports (https://app.local vs http://127.0.0.1:3000);\n2. Use mDNS for .local domains, so you can visit them from your phone or any other device connected to the same network;\n3. Locally-trusted development certificates (read on filosottile/mkcert how to trust certificates on mobile devices).\n\nUse-cases:\n1. Simulate production-like subdomains (e.g., blog.example.com, api.example.com);\n2. Test cookies scoped to specific domains;\n3. Preview multi-tenant routing (e.g., tenant1.example.com, tenant2.example.com);\n4. Use third-party APIs that need HTTPS.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/3v0k4/ser","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"898c8ed3b4b414bf883e03aeef866464acb46bf04f6e299a4dd862f2717a3acf","spec_sha":"d525355d2f6d57ee8caa30d7f5717f1d3157b65a56e97f5284578d0a372e5a04","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ser","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ser-0.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/3v0k4/ser","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/3v0k4/ser"}
