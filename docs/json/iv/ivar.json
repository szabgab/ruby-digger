Ivar lets you use plain-old instance variables,\nand automatically checks for typos.\n\nIvar waits until an instance is created to do the checking, then uses Prism to look\nfor variables that don't match what was set in initialization. So it's a little bit\ndynamic, a little bit static. It doesn't encumber your instance variable reads and\nwrites with any extra checking. And with the `:warn_once` policy, it won't overwhelm\nyou with output.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"75309318376b9c63d431dc8c86422a631c95fb31477721b65a701da36739e4a0","spec_sha":"9b68ba8dcb7deb5e50ca5279b81dad5bc7e4757c3ba23299d96dd5fd22e08278","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ivar","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ivar-0.4.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"prism","requirements":"~> 1.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/avdi/ivar"}
