This gem contains the Mu deployment interface to cloud provider APIs. It will generate a sample configuration the first time it is invoked.\n\nMu will attempt to autodetect when it's being run in a virtual machine on a known cloud provider and activate the appropriate API with machine-based credentials. Installing this gem on an Amazon Web Service instance, for example, should automatically enable the MU::Cloud::AWS layer and attempt to use the machine's IAM Profile to communicate with the AWS API.\n\n","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause-Attribution"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"715ba26238a08c586d0e1b9152b9424161db23728e3e71ae0d092b8c97ecaba9","spec_sha":"709e45ed086766ad8072279527ea138b3011c2c3964f00f70424c02519f4077a","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cloud-mu","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cloud-mu-3.6.15.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/cloudamatic/mu","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cloud-mu/3.6.15","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"addressable","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"chronic_duration","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"color","requirements":"~> 1.8"},{"name":"colorize","requirements":"~> 0.8"},{"name":"erubis","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"faraday-multipart","requirements":"<= 1.0.4"},{"name":"inifile","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"json-schema","requirements":"~> 2.8"},{"name":"netaddr","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"net-ldap","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"net-ssh","requirements":"~> 7.2"},{"name":"net-ssh-multi","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"nokogiri","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"openssl-oaep","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"optimist","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"ruby-graphviz","requirements":"~> 1.2"},{"name":"rubyzip","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simple-password-gen","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"slack-notifier","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"solve","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/cloudamatic/mu"}
