This gem contains the Mu deployment interface to cloud provider APIs. It will generate a sample configuration the first time it is invoked.\n\nMu will attempt to autodetect when it's being run in a virtual machine on a known cloud provider and activate the appropriate API with machine-based credentials. Installing this gem on an Amazon Web Service instance, for example, should automatically enable the MU::Cloud::AWS layer and attempt to use the machine's IAM Profile to communicate with the AWS API.\n\n","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause-Attribution"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"7625bf7fd85b54e21cad4203d7d7dede4451204320ef308faef85147d97772da","spec_sha":"607baaa62fd360d28cc56834d646aa5e97210b101eb6c7791bd4acf0c36aa98a","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cloud-mu","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cloud-mu-3.6.8.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/cloudamatic/mu","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cloud-mu/3.6.8","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"addressable","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"aws-sdk","requirements":"~> 3.2"},{"name":"aws-sdk-core","requirements":"~> 3.214.0"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"chronic_duration","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"color","requirements":"~> 1.8"},{"name":"colorize","requirements":"~> 0.8"},{"name":"erubis","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"faraday-multipart","requirements":"<= 1.0.4"},{"name":"google-api-client","requirements":"~> 0.53.0"},{"name":"googleauth","requirements":"~> 1.2.0"},{"name":"inifile","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"json-schema","requirements":"~> 2.8"},{"name":"netaddr","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"net-ldap","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"net-ssh","requirements":"~> 7.2"},{"name":"net-ssh-multi","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"nokogiri","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"openssl-oaep","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"optimist","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rack","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"ruby-graphviz","requirements":"~> 1.2"},{"name":"rubyzip","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simple-password-gen","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"slack-notifier","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"solve","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"thin","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"winrm","requirements":"~> 2.3, >= 2.3.4"},{"name":"yard","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/cloudamatic/mu"}
