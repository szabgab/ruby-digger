It uses the SafePoller gem under the hood to safely poll messages at a specified interval, and gracefully handle shutdown events to avoid losing messages. It also integrates with Sidekiq's lifecycle events to start and stop the polling process automatically, and provides a simple interface to configure the SQS client and polling options.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/sidekiq-aws-sqs","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/sidekiq-aws-sqs"},"yanked":false,"sha":"929e713658f3c1cf5b2e39a08240f33a12b321d550584d72247d6dcd4e2b69de","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq-aws-sqs","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq-aws-sqs-0.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/sidekiq-aws-sqs","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/sidekiq-aws-sqs","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"aws-sdk-sqs","requirements":"~> 1.53"},{"name":"dry-configurable","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.1"},{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 6.0.0"},{"name":"safe_poller","requirements":"~> 0.0.1"},{"name":"sidekiq","requirements":">= 7.0.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/sidekiq-aws-sqs"}
