If it is there means is working.\n\nA Sidekiq job is the responsable to storing this key. If Sidekiq stops processing jobs\nthis key gets expired by Redis an consequently the http server will return a 500 error.\n\nThis Job is responsible to requeue itself for the next liveness probe.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/releases","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive","documentation_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/blob/v2.3.1/README.md"},"yanked":false,"sha":"62b9c730660a288b560683d45ecd4270f70968af9b8b2eb5e87b1b6a62d77848","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq_alive","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq_alive-2.3.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/blob/v2.3.1/README.md","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive/releases","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":"> 1.16"},{"name":"debug","requirements":"~> 1.6"},{"name":"rack-test","requirements":"~> 2.1.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"rspec-sidekiq","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"rubocop-shopify","requirements":"~> 2.10"},{"name":"solargraph","requirements":"~> 0.49.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"rack","requirements":"< 3"},{"name":"sidekiq","requirements":">= 5, < 8"},{"name":"webrick","requirements":">= 1, < 2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/arturictus/sidekiq_alive"}
