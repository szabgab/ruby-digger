If it is there means is working.\n\nA Sidekiq job is the responsable to storing this key. If Sidekiq stops processing jobs\nthis key gets expired by Redis an consequently the http server will return a 500 error.\n\nThis Job is responsible to requeue itself for the next liveness probe.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/releases","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive","documentation_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/blob/v3.1.1/README.md"},"yanked":false,"sha":"c0c785364039b16877e0ffda3d497777b6fd55aecff87dfa46b35429184b145f","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq-alive-next","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq-alive-next-3.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/blob/v3.1.1/README.md","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive/releases","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":"> 1.16"},{"name":"debug","requirements":"~> 1.6"},{"name":"rack-test","requirements":"~> 2.0.2"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"rspec-sidekiq","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"rubocop-shopify","requirements":"~> 2.10"},{"name":"solargraph","requirements":"~> 0.47.2"}],"runtime":[{"name":"rack","requirements":">= 3, < 4"},{"name":"rackup","requirements":">= 0.2"},{"name":"sidekiq","requirements":">= 7, < 8"},{"name":"webrick","requirements":">= 1, < 2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/andrcuns/sidekiq-alive"}
