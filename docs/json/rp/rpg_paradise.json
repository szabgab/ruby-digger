Furthermore I \nwill also include the unfinished code for the text-based MUD that \nwas once planned.\n\nAs I in general lack time to continue this hobby project, I \nthought it may be better to publish the code as it is. Be \nwarned: this is very beta-ish quality. I can not recommend \nanyone to use this project for anything serious.\n\nBe also made aware that this is on-going; I have not yet\nfinished publishing the old code, as I am trying to polish\nit a little before releasing it in its \"final\", though\nunfinished, form here.\n\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"e97360ecf4e578c6b0165737f1f160aa339ec6da60b06e171f0a46e8c77480b5","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rpg_paradise","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rpg_paradise-0.1.5.gem","homepage_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rpg_paradise/","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rpg_paradise/0.1.5","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"beautiful_url","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"colours","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"Other","vcs_uri":null}
