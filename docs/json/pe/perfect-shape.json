Additionally, it contains some purely mathematical algorithms like IEEEremainder (also known as IEEE-754 remainder).","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"803d06df2c43c5658b836b71ddf86dbcb15eb90e9dbe70ecbf590bed6cab9467","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/perfect-shape","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/perfect-shape-1.0.7.gem","homepage_uri":"http://github.com/AndyObtiva/perfect-shape","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/perfect-shape/1.0.7","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"juwelier","requirements":"~> 2.1.0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.14.4"},{"name":"puts_debuggerer","requirements":"~> 0.13.1"},{"name":"rake-tui","requirements":"> 0"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":"~> 3.12"}],"runtime":[{"name":"equalizer","requirements":">= 0.0.11, < 1.1.0"},{"name":"matrix","requirements":">= 0.4.2, < 1.1.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"http://github.com/AndyObtiva/perfect-shape"}
