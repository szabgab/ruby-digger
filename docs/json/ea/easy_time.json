A tolerant comparison\nallows for times from differing systems to be compared, even when the\nsystems are out of sync, using the relationship operators and methods\nlike \"newer?\", \"older?\", \"same?\" and \"between?\".  A tolerant comparison\nfor equality is where the difference of two values is less than the\ntolerance value (1 minute by default).  The tolerance can be configured,\neven set to zero.  Finally, all of the Time class and instance methods\nare available on the EasyTime class and instances.\n\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"github_repo":"ssh://github.com/aks/easy_time","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/aks/easy_time","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/aks/easy_time","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"8656b8f8295b1de35bf2896c7e97a337233f9f670851d73f86e646ac1d9556e9","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/easy_time","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/easy_time-1.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/aks/easy_time","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/aks/easy_time","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"activesupport","requirements":">= 6.1.4"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":"~> 2.1.4"},{"name":"fuubar","requirements":">= 2.5.0"},{"name":"guard","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"guard-rspec","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"guard-yard","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"pry-byebug","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"redcarpet","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec_junit","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec_junit_formatter","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0.82.0"},{"name":"rubocop-rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"terminal-notifier-guard","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":">= 0.9.24"}],"runtime":[{"name":"activesupport","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"circleci":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/aks/easy_time"}
