For each client connection, the server forks a worker process,\nwhich uses the current directory, stdin, stdout, stderr, and environment\nof the client process.  The worker process then processes the arguments\nprovided by the client. The client process waits until the worker process\ncloses the socket, which the worker process attempts to do right before\nit exits.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/blob/master/CHANGELOG","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by","mailing_list_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/discussions"},"yanked":false,"sha":"771236626cb9cffcb8a82ac8d5309970e1df53212d37fe6a0e71c31ce947a0f9","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/by","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/by-1.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"http://github.com/jeremyevans/by","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/discussions","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by/blob/master/CHANGELOG","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"m","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"minitest-global_expectations","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/by"}
