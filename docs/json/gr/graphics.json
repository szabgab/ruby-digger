Particularly it:\n\n* Uses degrees.\n* Draws in quadrant 1 (0-90 degrees).\n* Right hand rule: 0 degrees is east, 90 is north, etc.\n\nThese allow simple things like Trigonometry functions to work as\nexpected. It means that all that stuff you were taught in grade school\nstill work as intended. This makes one less thing you have to adjust\nwhen implementing your simulation.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/graphics"},"yanked":false,"sha":"f739e9b7793e4b763dfa15f8cd81fda92e6bb9c52823ee1f9714dbc47759f415","spec_sha":"1fdf3708c6cdac841fb6305baff03e27299c15c741d95476a8b0b10f07a06d5e","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/graphics","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/graphics-1.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/graphics","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.2"},{"name":"rake-compiler","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 4.0, < 7"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/graphics"}
