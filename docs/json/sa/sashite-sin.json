This gem implements the SIN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable identifier objects and functional programming\nprinciples. SIN uses single ASCII letters with case-based side encoding (A-Z for first player,\na-z for second player), enabling clear distinction between different style families in\nmulti-style gaming environments. Perfect for cross-style matches, game engines, and hybrid\ngaming systems requiring compact style identification with enhanced collision resolution.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/sin.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/sin/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"0cd768e877cc833473128b2fb2848a342725dc9ebbc6d3d188039909e820931f","spec_sha":"8c81e6428e158df2388123af52ff743b308601d10558c6513ed0778a56fe8c20","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-sin","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-sin-2.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/sin.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb"}
