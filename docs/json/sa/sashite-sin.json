This gem implements the SIN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable identifier objects and functional programming\nprinciples. SIN uses single ASCII letters with case-based side encoding (A-Z for first player,\na-z for second player), enabling clear distinction between different style families in\nmulti-style gaming environments. Perfect for cross-style matches, game engines, and hybrid\ngaming systems requiring compact style identification with enhanced collision resolution.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/sin.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/sin/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"e21ceb1d9f28b9b675f16f8ff98af3c506d7e6d9dc018c27ffb17e0be67788fd","spec_sha":"03aabc6c8e292a4b98c022e5d47f33bb263610d6a259614f52229372907a2987","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-sin","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-sin-2.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/sin.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/sin.rb"}
