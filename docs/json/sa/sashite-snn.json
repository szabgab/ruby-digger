This gem implements the SNN Specification v1.0.0\nwith a modern Ruby interface featuring immutable style name objects and functional programming\nprinciples.\n\nSNN uses case-consistent alphabetic names (e.g., \"CHESS\", \"SHOGI\", \"XIANGQI\" for first player;\n\"chess\", \"shogi\", \"xiangqi\" for second player) to unambiguously represent both style identity\nand player assignment. As a foundational primitive with no dependencies, SNN serves as a building\nblock for formal style identification across the Sashit√© ecosystem.\n\nFormat: All uppercase OR all lowercase alphabetic characters only (no digits, no special characters).\nIdeal for game engines, protocols, and tools requiring clear and extensible style identifiers.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/snn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"c9e1dc98e24e05a7d1e0b14a2d1a7098b64506e86d9ddfe9232b5e18d7f3bb87","spec_sha":"d62bb884f155a2274809a08021f8dacd4e8b9c2a835c0355ee0250c56b62da63","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn-3.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb"}
