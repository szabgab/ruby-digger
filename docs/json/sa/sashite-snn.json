This gem implements the SNN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable style objects and functional programming\nprinciples. SNN uses single ASCII letters with case-based side encoding (A-Z for first player,\na-z for second player), enabling clear distinction between different style families in\nmulti-style gaming environments. Perfect for cross-style matches, game engines, and hybrid\ngaming systems requiring compact style identification.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/snn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"4d9a0ce25c636f2017e15d404a6bdd9dbefd349565f85c80dabfa2f8c9fd30d0","spec_sha":"ec5cbd53e5b9ddf8bacd08c94b6713cd8f2691a960897a2114818b4f34dcdd34","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn-2.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb"}
