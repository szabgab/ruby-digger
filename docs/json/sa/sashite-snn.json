This gem implements the SNN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable style name objects and functional programming\nprinciples. SNN uses canonical ASCII names (e.g., \"Shogi\", \"Go9x9\") to unambiguously refer\nto game styles across variants and traditions. Ideal for engines, protocols, and tools that\nneed clear and extensible style identifiers.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/snn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"8e9f7759897eca4c882ea0bf57c5fe3e25ec6e66833c7f7f90b705509d32b64a","spec_sha":"b9f2cbcebe5082aaf2fb33df652f05c1aa4f46805e0d9250152e5ed2e929eeea","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-snn-3.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/snn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/snn.rb"}
