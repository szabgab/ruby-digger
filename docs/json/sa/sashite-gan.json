GAN combines Style Name Notation (SNN) and Piece Identifier Notation (PIN) with a colon separator to provide complete, unambiguous piece identification. Represents all four fundamental piece attributes: Type, Side, State, and Style. Enables cross-style gaming, immutable transformations, and component extraction with to_pin/to_snn methods. Built on sashite-snn and sashite-pin gems.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/gan.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/gan/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"91ee81494f387ffd2fa451623359477820659f0b59751eba24308a90718f8c0c","spec_sha":"0ff25b3975a82aa95c683ecc4377928b3a83ba297a3b3c3470acc707cdde66fa","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-gan","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-gan-5.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/gan.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-pin","requirements":"~> 2.0.2"},{"name":"sashite-snn","requirements":"~> 1.1.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/gan.rb"}
