This gem implements the PCN Specification v1.0.0\nwith a modern Ruby interface featuring immutable game objects and functional programming\nprinciples. PCN integrates the SashitÃ© ecosystem specifications (PMN for moves, FEEN for\npositions, and SNN for style identification) to create a unified, rule-agnostic game recording\nsystem. Supports traditional single-variant games and cross-variant scenarios where players\nuse different game systems, with complete metadata tracking including player information,\ntournament context, and game status. Perfect for game engines, database storage, game analysis\ntools, and archival systems requiring comprehensive game record management across diverse\nabstract strategy board games.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pcn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pcn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"6c37b466680852b1910e502d8661903c05c55fb2dffcc35e2e6fcdb1f5b77df7","spec_sha":"98381cf62a6deb30215e06f0bea509cba3ba4f6f4175ea3dddea10f535421ee7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pcn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pcn-0.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pcn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-cgsn","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"sashite-feen","requirements":"~> 0.3"},{"name":"sashite-pmn","requirements":"~> 1.1"},{"name":"sashite-snn","requirements":"~> 3.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pcn.rb"}
