This gem implements the PIN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable identifier objects and functional programming\nprinciples. PIN uses single ASCII letters with optional state modifiers and case-based\nside encoding (A-Z for first player, a-z for second player), enabling precise and portable\nidentification of pieces across multiple games. Perfect for game engines, board game notation\nsystems, and hybrid gaming platforms requiring compact, stateful piece representation.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pin.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pin/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"699aae49e724d69ec9ffa209355ebc2c6dc54d314bd6403e15263812c45d1e58","spec_sha":"8929948286ae39ba6e81d2e96572692b83dafb388829776d61f6bc93d7ec0420","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pin","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pin-3.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pin.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pin.rb"}
