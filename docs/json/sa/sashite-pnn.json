This gem implements the PNN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable piece name objects and functional programming\nprinciples. PNN uses canonical ASCII names with optional state modifiers and optional terminal\nmarkers (e.g., \"KING\", \"queen\", \"+ROOK\", \"-pawn\", \"KING^\", \"+GENERAL^\") to unambiguously\nrefer to game pieces across variants and traditions. Ideal for engines, protocols, and tools\nthat need clear and extensible piece identifiers.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pnn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pnn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"fd32c4ce6f5feadd1606896818300f46153f30b80bc0a6b61f3d82d44c117320","spec_sha":"d1463b3c82d367167f980e9afb1ec7bed21dbf283d4dcf8fb9a71c5c2f1b21e0","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pnn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pnn-3.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pnn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pnn.rb"}
