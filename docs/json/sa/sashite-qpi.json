This gem implements the QPI Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable identifier objects and functional programming\nprinciples. QPI enables complete piece identification with all four fundamental attributes\n(family, type, side, state) while supporting cross-style gaming environments. Perfect for\nmulti-tradition board games, hybrid gaming systems, and game engines requiring comprehensive\npiece identification across different game styles and traditions.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/qpi.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/qpi/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"40d002242a678255200bba2325b0ffc46843794d02d4ebccee549e0a22fb9881","spec_sha":"be91311d47ba91509d58521b7630d900fcaf750e87a4ec5f0a8bccf72974f765","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-qpi","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-qpi-2.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/qpi.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-pin","requirements":"~> 3.2.0"},{"name":"sashite-sin","requirements":"~> 2.1.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/qpi.rb"}
