PAN provides an intuitive operator-based syntax with six core operators: \"-\" (move to empty square), \"+\" (capture), \"~\" (special moves with side effects), \"*\" (drop to board), \".\" (drop with capture), and \"=\" (in-place transformation), plus \"...\" (pass turn).\nSupports coordinates via CELL specification and piece identifiers via EPIN specification. Handles transformations (\"e7-e8=Q\"), enhanced/diminished states (\"+R\", \"-P\"), and style derivation markers (\"K'\"). Provides comprehensive validation, immutable action objects, and functional API design.\nExamples: \"e2-e4\" (move), \"d1+f3\" (capture), \"e1~g1\" (castling), \"P*e5\" (drop), \"e7-e8=Q\" (promotion), \"...\" (pass), \"+d4\" (static capture), \"e4=+P\" (modify).\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pan.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pan/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"9220ce95f07d7ffe540ecd731e81039e99a95c142e366c2dc996232a2fe2f0ea","spec_sha":"b48cfe944258b44d676b2cb19022998de6c2ef49de64e278092e18d724e27e63","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pan","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pan-4.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pan.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-cell","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"sashite-epin","requirements":"~> 1.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pan.rb"}
