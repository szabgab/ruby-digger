This gem implements\nthe PMN Specification v1.0.0 with a functional Ruby interface, breaking down complex movements\ninto sequences of atomic actions while remaining completely independent of specific game rules.\nPMN reveals the underlying mechanics of any board game move through sequential action\ndecomposition, supporting both explicit and inferred piece specifications. Built on CELL\n(coordinate encoding), HAND (reserve notation), and QPI (piece identification) specifications,\nit enables universal move representation across chess variants, shōgi, xiangqi, and any\nabstract strategy game. Perfect for game engines, move validators, and board game analysis tools.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"wiki_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pmn/1.0.0/examples/","funding_uri":"https://github.com/sponsors/sashite","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pmn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pmn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"7a79eb29f0b5b2e47eaae09f1d5c3fe877a1943c87747c09b059539f3fb3833d","spec_sha":"b6a6dd189ac98c48030f7c93ca5be4e6258851f521c0c70ff0675941af9bb5e9","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pmn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-pmn-1.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","wiki_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/pmn/1.0.0/examples/","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pmn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":"https://github.com/sponsors/sashite","dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-cell","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"sashite-hand","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"sashite-qpi","requirements":"~> 1.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb"}
