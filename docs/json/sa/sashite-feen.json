This gem implements the FEEN Specification v1.0.0 with\na modern Ruby interface featuring immutable position objects and functional programming\nprinciples. FEEN extends traditional FEN notation to support multiple game systems (chess,\nshōgi, xiangqi, makruk), cross-style games, multi-dimensional boards, and captured pieces\nheld in reserve. Built on EPIN (piece notation) and SIN (style notation) foundations,\nFEEN enables canonical position representation across diverse abstract strategy board games.\nPerfect for game engines, position analysis tools, and hybrid gaming systems requiring\ncomprehensive board state representation.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/feen.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/feen/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"9a69983b76daecf185b463102046ce2fc580844b05dbee9e983ec7d826621525","spec_sha":"0d678c12e5d6dd45e45cdb45c9dcec401c4e79cd15b20a72e4d46c4fdf8e26c5","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-feen","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-feen-0.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/feen.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"sashite-epin","requirements":"~> 1.1"},{"name":"sashite-sin","requirements":"~> 2.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/feen.rb"}
