This gem implements the CGSN Specification v1.0.0 with\na minimal Ruby interface featuring immutable status objects and functional programming principles.\nCGSN defines standardized identifiers for terminal conditions (checkmate, stalemate, bareking,\nmareking, insufficient), player actions (resignation, agreement, illegalmove), and temporal\nconstraints (timelimit, movelimit, repetition), enabling precise and portable status identification\nacross multiple games and variants. Perfect for game engines, notation systems, and hybrid gaming\nplatforms requiring consistent, rule-agnostic game state representation.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"wiki_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/cgsn/1.0.0/examples/","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/cgsn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/cgsn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"7126e732e8175c6c067368a401d4cf003164267ba37cfab8e809dc4ca85063cb","spec_sha":"f74a62bc1f434fb3f4f4c7423b920098fb474ec11cfadcecd986c15d6b4ad5e9","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-cgsn","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/sashite-cgsn-0.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb","wiki_uri":"https://sashite.dev/specs/cgsn/1.0.0/examples/","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/cgsn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/cgsn.rb"}
