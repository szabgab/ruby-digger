This gem allows you to create state\n    machines for solving complex tasks, enhancing the final result by leveraging internal logic (state machine)\n    and external tools (OpenAI generative intelligence).\n\n    Features:\n    - State Machine: Easily create and manage state machines to model various states and transitions in your application.\n    - OpenAI Integration: Utilize the capabilities of generative intelligence to make decisions and perform tasks, improving the quality and accuracy of results.\n    - Flexibility and Extensibility: Customize the behavior of the state machine and OpenAI integration according to your needs.\n    - Ease of Use: Intuitive syntax and documentation make it easy to get started with the gem.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://ai.oxteam.me","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/neonix20b/ox-ai-workers/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/neonix20b/ox-ai-workers"},"yanked":false,"sha":"2615101284896f8b15e0af0f4faf09c9b27f27b0a2bcb2edb1b8ab7ebf20d2dd","spec_sha":"372634ff26f956e69a927625393da2b900ff1f3163fcb5f68808a9434dc8146f","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ox-ai-workers","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ox-ai-workers-0.5.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://ai.oxteam.me","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/neonix20b/ox-ai-workers","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/neonix20b/ox-ai-workers/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"colorize","requirements":"~> 1"},{"name":"faraday","requirements":">= 1"},{"name":"faraday-multipart","requirements":">= 1"},{"name":"i18n","requirements":">= 1"},{"name":"ptools","requirements":">= 1"},{"name":"ruby-openai","requirements":">= 7"},{"name":"state_machine","requirements":">= 1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/neonix20b/ox-ai-workers"}
