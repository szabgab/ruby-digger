Angelo, Jr.","info":"  branch-name is a gem that provides a command-line interface that allows you to accomplish several tasks, tasks I personally find myself having to carry out every time I work on a feature branch. I created this gem for myself; however, you are free to use it yourself, if any of these tasks fits into your personal routine:\n\n  1. Formulate a git feature branch name, given a jira ticket and jira ticket description. Why? Because I am constantly having to create git feature branch names that are based on jira ticket and jira ticket descriptions.\n  2. Optionally create a \"project\" based on the branch name (formulated in step 1 above). Why? Because I'm constantly having to create folders to manage files associated with the feature branches I am working on.\n  3. Optionally use and manage default options that determine the git feature branch name formulated, project greated, and default files associated with the project.Why? Because I routinely have to create files to support the feature I am working on and associate them with the feature I am working on. For example: scratch.rb to hold scratch code, snippets.rb to hold code to execute to perform redundant tasks, and readme.txt files to document things I need to remember.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"9efa48d1332619d3875ec7169535682a5d6267ee2a92f460f1207c6e5b694ecd","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/branch-name","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/branch-name-3.10.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"activesupport","requirements":"~> 7.0, >= 7.0.4"},{"name":"colorize","requirements":"~> 0.8.1"},{"name":"os","requirements":"~> 1.1, >= 1.1.4"},{"name":"thor","requirements":"~> 1.2, >= 1.2.1"},{"name":"thor_nested_subcommand","requirements":"~> 1.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/branch-name"}
