It streamlines the development workflow by not only creating the backend structure with Rails but also automating the setup of a frontend directory using Next.js. Upon running the scaffold generator, this gem intelligently generates a Next.js application within the specified frontend directory.\n\nThe generated Next.js app follows best practices, including a structured page routing system, ensuring that each resource created by the scaffold has its corresponding page and components. This integration enables developers to seamlessly transition between Rails backend and Next.js frontend development, fostering a cohesive and efficient development environment.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- **Automatic Frontend Setup:** The gem automates the creation of a frontend directory within the Rails project, ready for Next.js development.\n- **Page Routing Integration:** All scaffolded resources come with their own pages and components, organized using Next.js' page routing system.\n- **Effortless Transition:** Developers can seamlessly switch between Rails backend and Next.js frontend development within the same project.\n- **Boosted Productivity:** Accelerate development by eliminating the manual setup of frontend components and pages, allowing developers to focus on building features.\n\nIntegrate `next_rails_scaffold` into your Ruby on Rails projects to enjoy a streamlined, organized, and efficient full-stack development experience.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails#readme","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"3720ebde757f84f8ba472a742d2ab7631d1bf2b6532c04475ea364eeac64c564","spec_sha":"7d373e9d12e7f671e5173cec58f79dfb9942734f492963f6bb2487672834ffa7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/next_rails_scaffold","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/next_rails_scaffold-0.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails#readme","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 7.1.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/raphox/next-rails"}
