Nesta has the simplicity of a static site\ngenerator, but (being a fully fledged Rack application) allows you to\nserve dynamic content on demand.\n\nContent is stored on disk in plain text files (there is no database).\nEdit your content in a text editor and keep it under version control\n(most people use git, but any version control system will do fine).\n\nImplementing your site's design is easy, but Nesta also has a small\nselection of themes to choose from.\n","licenses":[],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"19dacb6e1a248fd4ddcf180295b11252ef549a8ccd2da43951fe1c5853271824","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/nesta","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/nesta-0.15.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://nestacms.com","wiki_uri":"","documentation_uri":"http://nestacms.com/docs","mailing_list_uri":"http://librelist.com/browser/nesta/","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gma/nesta","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/gma/nesta/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"byebug","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"capybara","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"minitest-reporters","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"mr-sparkle","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"haml","requirements":">= 3.1, < 6.0"},{"name":"haml-contrib","requirements":">= 1.0"},{"name":"rack","requirements":"~> 2"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rdiscount","requirements":"~> 2.1"},{"name":"RedCloth","requirements":"~> 4.2"},{"name":"sass-embedded","requirements":"~> 1.58"},{"name":"sinatra","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"tilt","requirements":"~> 2.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gma/nesta"}
