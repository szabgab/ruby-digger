It aims to support the complete GIF specification for both\n    encoding and decoding, as well as having a decent editing functionality, while\n    maintaining a succint syntax.\n\n    The current version is still preliminar, and only encoding is working, together\n    with a decent drawing suite. The gem is actively developed and decoding will\n    soon follow, so stay tuned if you're interested!\n","licenses":[],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gifenc"},"yanked":false,"sha":"11f9f400f5fc4da3951681c737a094d2437c6c8814025810d0fe47695d802cb6","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/gifenc","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/gifenc-0.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gifenc","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"lzwrb","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/gifenc"}
