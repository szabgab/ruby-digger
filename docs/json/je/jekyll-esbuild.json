By default, it\ntargets all static files with .js extension, but it can be\nconfigured to target only the files specified in a list, which\nalso allows including files of other content types supported by\nesbuild, such as TypeScript or JSX (still untested with this\nplugin, however). There are also other options to toggle bundling,\nminification, and source maps.\n","licenses":["Unlicense"],"metadata":{"license":"https://unlicense.org/","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/S8A/jekyll-esbuild","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/S8A/jekyll-esbuild"},"yanked":false,"sha":"d0c5619c5820cc943715bf56dc64e6d85bd2e531158d6c8676d8c8dd25d763f9","spec_sha":"a1722312f50e785376b6e9a509b6eaf6fe3f9776e011cb46e7f1820186f505a0","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-esbuild","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-esbuild-0.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/S8A/jekyll-esbuild","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/S8A/jekyll-esbuild","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 12.0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"jekyll","requirements":">= 3.0"},{"name":"open3","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/S8A/jekyll-esbuild"}
