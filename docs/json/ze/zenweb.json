It is website oriented rather than webpage oriented, unlike\nmost rendering tools. It is content oriented, rather than style\noriented, unlike most rendering tools. It uses a rubygems plugin\nsystem to provide a very flexible, and powerful system.\n\nZenweb 3 was inspired by jekyll. The filesystem layout is similar to\njekyll's layout, but zenweb isn't focused on blogs. It can do any sort\nof website just fine.\n\nZenweb uses rake to handle dependencies. As a result, scanning a\nwebsite and regenerating incrementally is not just possible, it is\nblazingly fast.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb/issues"},"yanked":false,"sha":"ac064f7d39512f5281b1597b690dfe6caf04c7ac19b298778b9927179f3f460b","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/zenweb","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/zenweb-3.11.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 4.0, < 7"}],"runtime":[{"name":"coderay","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"kramdown","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"kramdown-parser-gfm","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"kramdown-syntax-coderay","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"less","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"makerakeworkwell","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0.9, < 15"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/zenweb"}
