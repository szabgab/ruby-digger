This gem provides a consistent Ruby interface for serializing, deserializing, and validating moves across Chess, Shogi, Xiangqi, and other traditional or non-traditional variants. The v1.0.0 format uses simple 4-element arrays: [source_square, destination_square, piece_name, captured_piece], making it compact and language-agnostic while focusing on deterministic state transformations independent of game-specific rules.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pmn.rb/main","specification_uri":"https://sashite.dev/documents/pmn/1.0.0/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"fbcc311d90a7856569e4a32f8e9418c6e3878374681fc479ec475ffa2eab5851","spec_sha":"ad27a9a00fda272bdfdecd9dc8932506a610a4fac443c02cc951061942ae2ef8","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/portable_move_notation","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/portable_move_notation-3.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/github/sashite/pmn.rb/main","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sashite/pmn.rb"}
