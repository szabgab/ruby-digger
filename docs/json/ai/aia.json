Complete shell integration allows a prompt to access system environment variables and execut shell commands as part of the prompt content.  In addition full embedded Ruby support is provided given even more dynamic prompt conditional content.  It is a generalized power house that rivals specialized gen-AI tools.  aia currently supports \"mods\" and \"sgpt\" CLI tools.  aia uses \"ripgrep\" and \"fzf\" CLI utilities to search for and select prompt files to send to the backend gen-AI tool along with supported context files.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"94a9e5f38f6bcae2afff03d598d156845be1b3c17c4d665ec91873d238c61578","spec_sha":"1d1ace7a68c038ace0a4a2c801731a66721b070c84333d2615efad042032c05e","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/aia","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/aia-0.8.3.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"debug_me","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"minitest-reporters","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"mocha","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"tocer","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"ai_client","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"amazing_print","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"os","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"prompt_manager","requirements":">= 0.4.1"},{"name":"reline","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"shellwords","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"toml-rb","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"tty-screen","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"tty-spinner","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"versionaire","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/MadBomber/aia"}
