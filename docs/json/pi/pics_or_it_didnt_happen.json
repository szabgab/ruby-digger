Making this file public may be undesireable for security reasons, or perhaps simply because it is not worth the overhead of multiple HTTP requests.\nThis gem provides a utility method that takes a locally-saved image file, perhaps within your non-public tmp directory, encodes it as Base64, and returns an HTML <img> element with the correct data URL attributes.\nIt is made possible by the RFC 2397 scheme, which is now fairly well supported in modern browsers.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","documentation_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen"},"yanked":false,"sha":"862fb6628fd6479a469ab23b5de5cbf96bfcbe286686e3afe81e0a964350107b","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/pics_or_it_didnt_happen-1.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/NeomindLabs/pics_or_it_didnt_happen"}
