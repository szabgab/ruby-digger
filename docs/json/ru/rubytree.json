It\n    provides simple APIs to store named nodes, and to access, modify, and\n    traverse the tree.\n\n    The data model is node-centric, where nodes in the tree are the primary\n    structural elements. It supports all common tree-traversal methods (pre-order,\n    post-order, and breadth first).\n\n    RubyTree mixes in the Enumerable and Comparable modules and behaves like a\n    standard Ruby collection (iteration, comparison, etc.).\n\n    RubyTree also includes a binary tree implementation, which provides in-order\n    node traversal besides the other methods.\n\n    RubyTree can import from and export to JSON, and supports Rubyâ€™s object\n    marshaling.\n","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause"],"metadata":{"rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"f1a0fb4ba56fe90ba4458891d78cd9597122864f66144fb3198fb0bb80ea0c82","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubytree","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubytree-2.0.2.gem","homepage_uri":"http://rubytree.anupamsg.me","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/wiki","documentation_uri":"http://rubytree.anupamsg.me/rdoc/index.html","mailing_list_uri":"","source_code_uri":"http://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":"~> 6.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0, > 3.10"},{"name":"rtagstask","requirements":"~> 0.0.4"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"rubocop-rake","requirements":"~> 0.0"},{"name":"rubocop-rspec","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":"~> 0.21"},{"name":"simplecov-lcov","requirements":"~> 0.8"},{"name":"test-unit","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":"~> 0.0, >= 0.9.20"}],"runtime":[{"name":"json","requirements":"~> 2.0, > 2.3.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"http://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree"}
