It outputs\ns-expressions which can be manipulated and converted back to ruby via\nthe ruby2ruby gem.\n\nAs an example:\n\n    def conditional1 arg1\n      return 1 if arg1 == 0\n      return 0\n    end\n\nbecomes:\n\n    s(:defn, :conditional1, s(:args, :arg1),\n      s(:if,\n        s(:call, s(:lvar, :arg1), :==, s(:lit, 0)),\n        s(:return, s(:lit, 1)),\n        nil),\n      s(:return, s(:lit, 0)))\n\nTested against 801,039 files from the latest of all rubygems (as of 2013-05):\n\n* 1.8 parser is at 99.9739% accuracy, 3.651 sigma\n* 1.9 parser is at 99.9940% accuracy, 4.013 sigma\n* 2.0 parser is at 99.9939% accuracy, 4.008 sigma\n* 2.6 parser is at 99.9972% accuracy, 4.191 sigma\n* 3.0 parser has a 100% parse rate.\n  * Tested against 2,672,412 unique ruby files across 167k gems.\n  * As do all the others now, basically.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/issues"},"yanked":false,"sha":"17d0c8bbef7fcdf99b1070bb2555d49111758f75d312e8799f66df831ebdcbe3","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_parser","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_parser-3.20.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"oedipus_lex","requirements":"~> 2.6"},{"name":"racc","requirements":"~> 1.5"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 10, < 15"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 4.0, < 7"}],"runtime":[{"name":"sexp_processor","requirements":"~> 4.16"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser"}
