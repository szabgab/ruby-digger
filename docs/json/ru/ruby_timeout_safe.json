It uses Ruby's threading and monotonic\ntime to ensure that timeouts are enforced even in the presence of blocking operations\nor long-running computations.\n\nThe gem defines a `RubyTimeoutSafe` module with a `timeout` method that executes a given\nRuby block with a specified timeout duration. If the block execution exceeds the timeout,\na `Timeout::Error` exception is raised.\n\nThis implementation leverages Ruby's built-in threading and monotonic time functions to\nprovide a robust timeout mechanism.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"db4f79a22141e7494dd3c74b6ca480ace8556a77cef4510f5855cf89fd2b2aaf","spec_sha":"f50b73ff9584809fc4c3ed4faa8fd9930f01d3bf75db66fc9000ce4f5c09ba35","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_timeout_safe","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_timeout_safe-0.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe"}
