It uses Ruby's threading and monotonic\ntime to ensure that timeouts are enforced even in the presence of blocking operations\nor long-running computations.\n\nThe gem defines a `RubyTimeoutSafe` module with a `timeout` method that executes a given\nRuby block with a specified timeout duration. If the block execution exceeds the timeout,\na `Timeout::Error` exception is raised.\n\nThis implementation leverages Ruby's built-in threading and monotonic time functions to\nprovide a robust timeout mechanism.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"ba935371d693ec2cbc3cf7f4bedf3a9e8e48a6486b28e15dd0fefed3122dc04b","spec_sha":"e267600020fe69336f77211a41db009022aaa042548e9ec6d95a0ff27de57c43","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_timeout_safe","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_timeout_safe-1.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/sebyx07/ruby-timeout-safe"}
