The programmer can avoid using JS syntax, which is helpful. Everything is done automatically; all you have to do is start the server and build a project using scaffolding.\n\nWrite your code using the JS api and Ruby syntax, and the server will automatically translate it. It then stores it in a file with the extension \".js\". You will then be able to publish the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or directly to the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/), and you will have a website that is written in the native JS language.\n\nSee GitHub for further information. |> https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js"},"yanked":false,"sha":"f8e15994a7733af531bfa5a0f211a51ee0e1ad56611de7d0efdc16351536b0c4","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite-1.0.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"listen","requirements":"~> 3.7"},{"name":"ruby2js","requirements":"~> 5.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js"}
