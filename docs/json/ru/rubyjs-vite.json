The programmer can avoid using JS syntax, which is helpful. Everything is done automatically; all you have to do is start the server and build a project using scaffolding.\n\nWrite your code using the JS api and Ruby syntax, and the server will automatically translate it. It then stores it in a file with the extension \".js\". You will then be able to publish the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or directly to the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/), and you will have a website that is written in the native JS language.\n\n### Content\n- [1 Installation](#1-installation)\n- [2 Usage](#2-usage)\n  - [2.1 Scaffold](#21-scaffold)\n  - [2.2 More parameters](#22-more-parameters)\n- [3 Development](#3-development)\n- [4 Unexpected errors](#4-unexpected-errors)\n  - [4.1 Third-party libraries](#41-third-party-libraries)\n  - [4.2 NPM](#42-npm)\n- [5 Examples](#5-examples)\n- [6 Contributors](#6-contributors)\n\n## 1 Installation\nThe executable application and libraries are installed using the ruby gem during installation.\n\n```bash\ngem install rubyjs-vite\n```\n\n## 2 Usage\nRubyJS Vite has a unique command that can be used at the terminal called **rjsv**.\n\n### 2.1 Scaffold\nThe **—create** parameter should be followed by the project name if you want to create your own project.\n\n*Use this command as an example, then follow the instructions the terminal gives you:*\n```bash\nrjsv --create hello\n```\n\n![rjsv-scaffold](./public/rjsv_scaffold.gif)\n\n### 2.2 More parameters\nIf you only need to convert files to *.js* format rather than build scaffolding.\nTherefore, there is an argument for this function called **-c** or **—compile**.\n\nYou must include an additional parameter called **-w** or **—watch** so that the compilation always happens after saving the *.rjs* file.\n\nOther choices include which directory will be searched for updated files and which directory will house all transformed code. The code can also be converted into the chosen EC level, with 2021 as the default level. Enter **rjsv -h** in the terminal for more details.\n\n*Example for compiling and tracking files:*\n```bash\nrjsv -c -w -s src/rjs -o src/js\n```\n\n![rjsv-compile-watch](./public/rjsv_cw.gif)\n\n## 3 Development\nLook in the *'lib'* folder if you want to edit this RubyJS Vite project. Everything you require for file transformation and change tracking is available. The console portion is under the *'app'* subdirectory. Everything that needs to be executed with various arguments is available here. \n\n*The following third-party libraries are employed:*\n- [ruby2js](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby2js)\n- [listen](https://rubygems.org/gems/listen)\n\n## 4 Unexpected errors\nWhen using this utility, some problems could happen.\n\n### 4.1 Third-party libraries\nCertain library dependencies must be installed for the program to function as a whole. (The section on [development](#3-development) has more details regarding libraries.)\n\n*Use this command if the software indicates that the library was not found:*\n```bash\ngem install ruby2js &&\ngem install listen\n```\n\n### 4.2 NPM\nThe process of constructing a project could go wrong. This is because Vite is attempting to be installed using the NPM tool during the scaffolding phase. This indicates that your machine does not have NodeJS installed. [Installing it is necessary!](https://nodejs.org) Run a command in your project to install the Vite library after you've finished the installation.\n\n*Vite installation command:*\n```bash\nnpm install -D vite\n```\n\nYou can launch the server and begin developing your project after the installation has been successfully completed.\n\n*An order to launch the server:*\n```bash\nbin/server\n```\n\n## 5 Examples\nHere, I'll outline a few projects where RubyJS Vite was applied to alter code.\n\n- [adb2-weapon-rjs](https://github.com/filipvrba/adb2-weapon-rjs) - Here, a web application was built with scaffolding and uploaded to Vercel.\n- [suitescript-generator](https://github.com/filipvrba/suitescript-generator) - It is a console program that utilizes npm. Here, the file tracking and compilation command is employed. \n\n## 6 Contributors\n- [Filip Vrba](https://github.com/filipvrba) - creator and maintainer\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js"},"yanked":false,"sha":"4c91bfe6669839441b3bdb467ca1bf965d1813963f452543948cf15496739527","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite-1.0.0b.gem","homepage_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyjs-vite","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js"}
