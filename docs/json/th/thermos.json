Works with any ActiveJob backend (Sidekiq,\nSolid Queue, etc.) and any cache store (Redis, Memcached, Solid Cache, etc.).\nPerfect for API responses, JSON serialization, and view caching.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos/releases","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"21a2f2fcf7b16a09feb1a14319f527355c57318a84e929353aeb2b7b126213ff","spec_sha":"39ee649aafd06fe0224383381669e3b71edba7d9af7be041888edd9f63777e88","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/thermos","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/thermos-2.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos/releases","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"prettier","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"sqlite3","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 7.1, < 9"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/athal7/thermos"}
