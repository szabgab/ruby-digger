It uses lazy loading and lazy\ncomputing when possible and tries to produce small PDF files by default.\n","licenses":["AGPL-3.0","Nonstandard"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"8db11f731807cefeb0cada949555b2e460214c4e3024e82adb19f8096c3e0549","spec_sha":"2c8ae9c523828eb6a12b4c85400f544cf57291945efe7449b368217ba1cbc76f","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf-1.4.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://hexapdf.gettalong.org","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/wiki","documentation_uri":"http://hexapdf.gettalong.org/","mailing_list_uri":"","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"kramdown","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.16"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"reline","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"webrick","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"cmdparse","requirements":"~> 3.0, >= 3.0.3"},{"name":"geom2d","requirements":"~> 0.4, >= 0.4.1"},{"name":"openssl","requirements":">= 2.2.1"},{"name":"strscan","requirements":">= 3.1.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf"}
