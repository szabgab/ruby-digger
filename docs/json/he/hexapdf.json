It uses lazy loading and lazy\ncomputing when possible and tries to produce small PDF files by default.\n","licenses":["AGPL-3.0","Nonstandard"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"ff0701d94f1f0de501b9e46338d1ada040467efe16d1c8480898f734eae35762","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf-0.26.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://hexapdf.gettalong.org","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/wiki","documentation_uri":"http://hexapdf.gettalong.org/","mailing_list_uri":"","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"kramdown","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.16"},{"name":"reline","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"~> 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"cmdparse","requirements":"~> 3.0, >= 3.0.3"},{"name":"geom2d","requirements":"~> 0.3"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf"}
