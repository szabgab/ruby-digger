It uses lazy loading and lazy\ncomputing when possible and tries to produce small PDF files by default.\n","licenses":["AGPL-3.0","Nonstandard"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"78e32fc5a088a347bcb2cad4ab327cbdd0a0c5e1e77963b52460eef78d402582","spec_sha":"a640f2cb93d72a01e0441c35846bbe2179c7550fd278fa2ada6d6886aa49fa8c","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hexapdf-1.6.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://hexapdf.gettalong.org","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/wiki","documentation_uri":"http://hexapdf.gettalong.org/","mailing_list_uri":"","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"kramdown","requirements":"~> 2.3"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 6.0"},{"name":"minitest-mock","requirements":"~> 5.27"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"reline","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"webrick","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"cmdparse","requirements":"~> 3.0, >= 3.0.3"},{"name":"geom2d","requirements":"~> 0.4, >= 0.4.1"},{"name":"openssl","requirements":">= 2.2.1"},{"name":"strscan","requirements":">= 3.1.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf"}
