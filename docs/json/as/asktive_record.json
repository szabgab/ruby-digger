It lets you interact with your Rails database as if you were having a conversation with a knowledgeable    assistant. Instead of writing SQL or chaining ActiveRecord methods, you simply ask questions   in plain English—like (or any language) 'Who are my newest users?' or 'What products sold the most last month?'   — and get clear, human-friendly answers. AsktiveRecord translates your questions into database queries behind the  scenes, so you can focus on what you want to know, not how to write the query.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"1e7270f9eae1f05c0de6ae280fb79206c1f5495f5f275c373b574248559d86f7","spec_sha":"c1e26fce5cdad4cee2d4292ab53a9273ee29f6d5e14b21b4edbbb93703035f25","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/asktive_record","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/asktive_record-0.1.4.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"railties","requirements":">= 6.0"},{"name":"ruby-openai","requirements":"~> 8.1"},{"name":"zeitwerk","requirements":">= 2.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/rpossan/asktive_record"}
