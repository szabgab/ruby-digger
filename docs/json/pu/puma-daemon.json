Some folks were \nindeed happily using the `--daemonize` feature until in 5.0 they got an error that this flag is \nnot supported.\n\nSo, if you want to use the latest and greatest Puma 5+, but have it self-daemonize, \nthis gem is for you. Just use *pumad* binary instead of *puma*, or require 'puma/daemon' inside\nyour config file.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon"},"yanked":false,"sha":"a66613ccf5e18253b9f9cbab320fd66799a30b2aae9de8eca6f40545f4661654","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/puma-daemon","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/puma-daemon-0.2.3.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"asciidoctor","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"codecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"httparty","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"relaxed-rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec-its","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"puma","requirements":">= 5.0"},{"name":"rack","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon"}
