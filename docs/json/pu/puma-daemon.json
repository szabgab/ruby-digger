For example\nsystemd, Docker/Kubernetes, Heroku, etc. \n\nHaving said that, it was neat and often useful to daemonize Puma in development.\nThis gem adds this support to Puma 5 & 6 (hopefully) without breaking anything in Puma\nitself.\n\nSo, if you want to use the latest and greatest Puma 5+, but prefer to keep using built-in\ndaemonization, this gem if for you.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"6d020dfc06c1f6298796e117bbe230186714e8cbb005504e78b5241db9f78c48","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/puma-daemon","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/puma-daemon-0.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"asciidoctor","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"codecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"httparty","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"relaxed-rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec-its","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"puma","requirements":">= 5.0"},{"name":"rack","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon"}
