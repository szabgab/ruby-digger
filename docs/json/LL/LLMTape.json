In test environement, it records “tapes” (YAML fixtures of real LLM calls) and replays them on subsequent runs; when a tape is stale, it re-records to keep tests current. Production stays clean and safe, while CI avoids hammering the API every run--yielding deterministic tests, faster pipelines, and fewer tokens spent.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/amitleshed/LLMTape","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/amitleshed/LLMTape","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"a669e5d60b0efbfdd64eabd22a813f3e1ffc87188b30346f46d4b427df714fb0","spec_sha":"0f291eacf9515d4dc045c7f65b7264f8ae82ae0f8e21e0d918eeb5f50eef23cf","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/LLMTape","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/LLMTape-0.4.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/amitleshed/LLMTape","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/amitleshed/LLMTape","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/amitleshed/LLMTape"}
