It\nautomatically determines if the code in question has changed and\nbuilds it only when necessary. The extensions are then automatically\nloaded into the class/module that defines it.\n\nYou can even write extra builders that will allow you to write inlined\ncode in any language. Use Inline::C as a template and look at\nModule#inline for the required API.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/rubyinline"},"yanked":false,"sha":"839ef1393f34f5e0c1423b2378f00c17244e0580f43fdcf9b664c873bb431b90","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/RubyInline","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/RubyInline-3.14.0.gem","homepage_uri":"http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/rubyinline","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 4.0, < 7"}],"runtime":[{"name":"ZenTest","requirements":"~> 4.3"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/rubyinline"}
