Given an object or array of objects, hirb renders a view based on the object's class and/or ancestry. Hirb offers reusable views in the form of helper classes. The two main helpers, Hirb::Helpers::Table and Hirb::Helpers::Tree, provide several options for generating ascii tables and trees. Using Hirb::Helpers::AutoTable, hirb has useful default views for at least ten popular database gems i.e. Rails' ActiveRecord::Base. Other than views, hirb offers a smart pager and a console menu. The smart pager only pages when the output exceeds the current screen size. The menu is used in conjunction with tables to offer two dimensional menus.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"0725e66130242f75767228b6ac021c8a6b21685fe1a4776189a731330cff39b5","spec_sha":"7c186a6683fcb589825d7bd833eae68a83ee52403d8786827823d87ba1be88a6","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hirber","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/hirber-0.8.9.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/hirber/hirber","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/hirber/0.8.9","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bacon","requirements":"~> 1.1"},{"name":"bacon-bits","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"mocha","requirements":"~> 0.12.1"},{"name":"mocha-on-bacon","requirements":"~> 0.2.1"},{"name":"pry","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":">= 3.9"},{"name":"rspec_junit_formatter","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"circleci":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/hirber/hirber"}
