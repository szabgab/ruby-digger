This plugins\ncombats this issue by distributing the full test suite to a set of workers.\nEvery worker is a consuming from a single queue, so the tests get evenly\ndistributed and all workers will finish around the same time. Redis is used\nas coordinator, but when using this plugin without having access to Redis,\nit will use an in-memory coordinator.\n\nUsing multiple (virtual) machines for a test run is an (additional) source\nof flakiness. To combat flakiness, minitest-distributed implements resiliency\npatterns, like re-running a test on a different worker on failure, and\na circuit breaker for misbehaving workers.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/Shopify/minitest-distributed","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/Shopify/minitest-distributed","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"b4818e09b450a694868428178a2e0eabded9decf4d698099d9caa4e71080e67a","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-distributed","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-distributed-0.2.9.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/Shopify/minitest-distributed","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/Shopify/minitest-distributed","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.12"},{"name":"redis","requirements":">= 5.0.6, < 6"},{"name":"sorbet-runtime","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/Shopify/minitest-distributed"}
