Each test/spec\nsuite is run in one of the forks, allowing this to work correctly when using\nbefore_all/after_all/around_all hooks provided by minitest-hooks.  Using separate\nprocesses via fork can significantly improve spec performance when using MRI,\nand can work in cases where Minitest's default thread-based parallelism do not work,\nsuch as when specs modify the constant namespace.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/blob/master/CHANGELOG","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork","mailing_list_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/discussions"},"yanked":false,"sha":"c2ce22a65f7b5a35528f98ef15e388e7cf1630d0107bca0c7112cb5e441efb9e","spec_sha":"8676c5f01be147e85dbb6935d7a4d8c206b7372e3c460b24216c985ef67ec825","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-parallel_fork","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-parallel_fork-2.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"http://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/discussions","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork/blob/master/CHANGELOG","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"minitest-global_expectations","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"minitest-hooks","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"minitest","requirements":">= 5.15.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-parallel_fork"}
