It can be used to determine defined filename\nextensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely\nMIME type definitions.\n\nVersion 3.0 is a major release that requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility and removes\ndeprecated functions. The columnar registry format introduced in 2.6 has been\nmade the primary format; the registry data has been extracted from this library\nand put into {mime-types-data}[https://github.com/mime-types/mime-types-data].\nAdditionally, mime-types is now licensed exclusively under the MIT licence and\nthere is a code of conduct in effect. There are a number of other smaller\nchanges described in the History file.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"6109148e6a6e656607510b74571deff8ecd9a97ab0dcec9b7431bdd0b74460af","spec_sha":"5a307a08998190804cc96d2a3c0ce77fa6a1fcb8016263416851860a6dc94f71","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mime-types","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mime-types-3.6.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"hoe-halostatue","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"hoe-rubygems","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"minitest-autotest","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest-focus","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest-hooks","requirements":"~> 1.4"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 10.0, < 14"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 0.0"},{"name":"standard","requirements":"~> 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"logger","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"mime-types-data","requirements":"~> 3.2015"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/"}
