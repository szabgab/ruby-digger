It can be used to determine defined filename\nextensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely\nMIME type definitions.\n\nVersion 3.0 is a major release that requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility and removes\ndeprecated functions. The columnar registry format introduced in 2.6 has been\nmade the primary format; the registry data has been extracted from this library\nand put into [mime-types-data][data]. Additionally, mime-types is now licensed\nexclusively under the MIT licence and there is a code of conduct in effect.\nThere are a number of other smaller changes described in the History file.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"dcebf61c246f08e15a4de34e386ebe8233791e868564a470c3fe77c00eed5e56","spec_sha":"eec9e93d37cd25282d22ed8fbf96b8db7bf99fe75b91c03f423cc7e33a6d6c01","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mime-types","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mime-types-3.7.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.0"},{"name":"hoe-halostatue","requirements":"~> 2.0"},{"name":"hoe-rubygems","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"minitest-autotest","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest-focus","requirements":"~> 1.0"},{"name":"minitest-hooks","requirements":"~> 1.4"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 10.0, < 14"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 0.0"},{"name":"standard","requirements":"~> 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"logger","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"mime-types-data","requirements":"~> 3.2025, >= 3.2025.0507"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/"}
