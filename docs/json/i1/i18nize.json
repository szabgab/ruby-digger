It scans for missing or empty keys \nacross nested locale structures, and uses the DeepL API (Free or Pro) to translate \nthem from a chosen source locale (default: en).\n\nFeatures:\n- Detects and lists missing translation keys\n- Automatically translates and inserts values into the correct YAML files\n- Supports nested directories and multiple locale files (e.g. config/locales/api/en.yml)\n- Preserves I18n placeholders such as %{count}\n- Handles pluralization branches (one, other, etc.)\n- Source locale is treated as the single source of truth (conflicts are resolved by overwrite)\n- Simple CLI: `i18nize <locale>` or `i18nize <locale> --missing`\n\nThis gem streamlines the translation workflow, making it easier to maintain \nconsistent, up-to-date locale files across large Ruby on Rails applications.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"94ef0d42547e9641a37240101beaf61592875deb48f7ee8b79bda879858ba847","spec_sha":"cad954ae675f0403cc501ca6060632962ce97f45e65ceb7e058ee27271ba8963","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/i18nize","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/i18nize-0.5.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/nikolas2145/i18nize"}
