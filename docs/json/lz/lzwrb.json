It is highly configurable,\n    supporting both constant and variable code lengths, custom alphabets,\n    usage of clear/stop codes... It uses LSB packing order.\n\n    It is compatible with the GIF specification, and comes equipped with\n    several presets. Eventually I'd like to add compatibility with other\n    standards, such as the ones used for UNIX compress, PDF and TIFF.\n","licenses":[],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/lzwrb"},"yanked":false,"sha":"5502ec57058c4a0d16de1b3c1d9465db54b095496bb5732580b52cdf681742da","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/lzwrb","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/lzwrb-0.2.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/lzwrb","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/edelkas/lzwrb"}
