Every event adds automatic IP geolocation, and any arbitrary metadata you may want to add. The gem comes with polymorphic associations, and async support via ActiveJob, so you can track events in the background without any overhead. Great for tracking login attempts, file downloads, profile visits, or any interaction where knowing the where matters. It also allows you to trivially build analytics dashboards and audit logs for all your app events.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"e681e749ecb1e1ea639561e4a04489127bc4b0b12cabd35f297c4c3aa965b69b","spec_sha":"eff75ec0a9f408408afb6f4d9f5b74032befbf16518a7e947cb6f7cd3a25d415","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/footprinted","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/footprinted-0.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 7.0"},{"name":"trackdown","requirements":"~> 0.3"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/footprinted"}
