It circumvents schmucking around provisioning passwords by\ngenerating a link which you can pass to each of your users through\nsome other mechanism, that when visited logs them in and keeps them\nlogged in as long as you want. This is basically the equivalent of\nhaving a \"forgot password\" link without anybody having to click on\n\"forgot password\", and is perfectly adequate security in certain\ncontexts, namely the ones the author of this gem is interested in.\n","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"bcc67fe3148032eb3d4848829955518b8a2aa0481f70f824445f14ea5e1485c8","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/forget-passwords","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/forget-passwords-0.3.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-forget-passwords","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/forget-passwords/0.3.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.1"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 13.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":">= 3.9"}],"runtime":[{"name":"commander","requirements":">= 4.4"},{"name":"deep_merge","requirements":">= 1.2"},{"name":"dry-schema","requirements":">= 1.9.1"},{"name":"dry-types","requirements":">= 1.5.1"},{"name":"fcgi","requirements":">= 0.9.2.1"},{"name":"http-negotiate","requirements":">= 0.1.3"},{"name":"iso8601","requirements":">= 0.12"},{"name":"mail","requirements":">= 2.7.1"},{"name":"rack","requirements":"~> 2"},{"name":"sequel","requirements":">= 5.20"},{"name":"uuid-ncname","requirements":">= 0.2"},{"name":"uuidtools","requirements":">= 2.1"},{"name":"xml-mixup","requirements":">= 0.1.13"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-forget-passwords"}
