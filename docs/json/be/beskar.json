It actively defends against common threats by integrating a powerful Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block attacks like SQLi and XSS, an advanced bot detection system using JavaScript challenges and honeypots, and robust account takeover prevention to stop brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.\n\nBuilt as a mountable Rails Engine, it leverages core framework features like ActiveJob and Rails.cache to ensure high performance and minimal external dependencies. It includes a real-time dashboard for monitoring security events, giving you immediate insight into the threats your application faces. Drop it in, configure it, and get enterprise-grade security that feels like a natural extension of Rails.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://humadroid.io/beskar","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/humadroid-io/beskar"},"yanked":false,"sha":"8d06f0e6bb9a495bbda5cc8dbe47e1a961be5a3ad0a03921672e0059c96b565c","spec_sha":"2f540254024adf3449c4217c59363a09f5ccc053615c0a2e7ae11cc52cc172f7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/beskar","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/beskar-0.0.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://humadroid.io/beskar","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/humadroid-io/beskar","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"debug","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"devise","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"factory_bot_rails","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"mocha","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"ostruct","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"maxminddb","requirements":"~> 0.1"},{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 8.0.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/humadroid-io/beskar"}
