Developers then disable in-progress features until they are ready to be switched on in production, yet enable them locally and in staging environments for in-progress testing.\n\nThis gives developers the added benefit of being able to switch a feature off after release should big problems arise for a high risk feature.\n\nabstract_feature_branch additionally supports Domain Driven Design's pattern of Bounded Contexts by allowing developers to configure context-specific feature files if needed.\n\nabstract_feature_branch is one of the simplest and most minimalistic \"Feature Flags\" Ruby gems out there as it enables you to get started very quickly by simply leveraging YAML files without having to set up a data store if you do not need it (albeit, you also have the option to use Redis as a very fast in-memory data store).\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"e827e0c552f706f066be2062cdebd6b1199572c6f38f8321828b10ec582229a4","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/abstract_feature_branch","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/abstract_feature_branch-1.5.0.gem","homepage_uri":"http://github.com/AndyObtiva/abstract_feature_branch","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/abstract_feature_branch/1.5.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.1.4"},{"name":"jeweler","requirements":"~> 2.3.9"},{"name":"psych","requirements":"= 3.3.4"},{"name":"rake-tui","requirements":"~> 0.2"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":"= 5.1.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"= 2.14.1"}],"runtime":[{"name":"deep_merge","requirements":">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"http://github.com/AndyObtiva/abstract_feature_branch"}
