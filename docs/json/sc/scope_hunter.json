It indexes model scopes, canonicalizes relation chains, and flags matches with an autocorrect that replaces the initial query with Model.scope while preserving any trailing methods. This keeps query logic DRY, improves readability, and helps teams discover and reuse well-named scopes.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org","default_lint_roller_plugin":"ScopeHunter::Plugin"},"yanked":false,"sha":"0e94ab13a1548913966270d1ce8a2ee460a4e54e0ecc811e6c67d645711c787e","spec_sha":"31c161334b88e85e82867eaf0fca80e63bcc3b68552465b4619d7ef084b1139d","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/scope_hunter","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/scope_hunter-0.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"standard","requirements":">= 1.40"}],"runtime":[{"name":"parser","requirements":"~> 3.3"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 1.60"},{"name":"rubocop-ast","requirements":"~> 1.32"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/ajithbuddy/scope_hunter"}
