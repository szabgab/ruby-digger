Alice realizes her migration depends on\nBob's, but the migration timestamps are out of order. The `rebase-migration`\ncommand line tool can be used to reorder Alice's new migrations to have the\nlatest timestamp in the sequence.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo rebase all new migrations with respect to the `main` git branch:\n\n```console\n$ bundle exec rebase-migrations\n```\n\nTo rebase all new migrations with respect to a different branch:\n\n```console\n$ bundle exec rebase-migrations my-branch\n```\n\nThe command has a `--check` argument that is useful for CI. To check that all\nnew migrations are the latest in the sequence:\n\n```console\n$ bundle exec rebase-migrations --check\n```\n\nIt will exit with status code 1 if the check fails. The `--check` form also\naccepts a branch argument.\n\n### Skipping Migrations\n\nTo skip a specific migration files from the `--check` include `_skip_rebase` in\nits filename.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"565e3b4905d121ba88b52c0694f53f78e452e51a5e1ac8c67c7fecace575c019","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails-rebase-migrations","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails-rebase-migrations-1.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Books/rebase-migrations","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rails-rebase-migrations/1.0.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 6.1, < 8"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Books/rebase-migrations"}
