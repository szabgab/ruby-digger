Tasks and dependencies are\nspecified in standard Ruby syntax.\nRake has the following features:\n  * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax.\n    No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)\n  * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.\n  * Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.\n  * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.\n  * Supports parallel execution of tasks.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/blob/v13.2.0/History.rdoc","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/tree/v13.2.0","documentation_uri":"https://ruby.github.io/rake"},"yanked":false,"sha":"f6c1ae27806904a33733be246568ae0937204f1386d8f0774bf3f81c6d269b53","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rake","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rake-13.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://ruby.github.io/rake","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/tree/v13.2.0","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/blob/v13.2.0/History.rdoc","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/ruby/rake/tree/v13.2.0"}
