{"gems":{"name":"ragerender","downloads":792,"version":"0.1.5","version_created_at":"2025-09-06T22:30:54.890Z","version_downloads":24,"platform":"ruby","authors":"Simon Worthington","info":"== What's this?\n\n{ComicFury}[https://comicfury.com] is an excellent no-bullshit webcomic hosting\nsite created and maintained by the legend Kyo. You should support them on\n{Patreon}[https://www.patreon.com/comicfury]!\n\n{Jekyll}[https://jekyllrb.com] is a highly regarded and widespread static site\ngenerator. It builds simple slowly-changing content into HTML files using\ntemplates.\n\nRageRender allows you to use your ComicFury templates to generate a static\nversion of your webcomic site using Jekyll. You just supply your templates,\ncomics and blogs, and RageRender will output a site that mimics your ComicFury\nsite.\n\nWell, I say \"mimics\". Output is a static site, which means all of the\ninteractive elements of ComicFury don't work. This includes comments,\nsubscriptions, search, and comic management.\n\n=== But why?!\n\nRageRender allows those of us who work on making changes to ComicFury site\ntemplates to test our changes before we put them live.\n\nWith RageRender, you can edit your CSS, HTML templates and site settings before\nyou upload them to ComicFury. This makes the process of testing changes quicker\nand makes it much more likely that you catch mistakes before any comic readers\nhave a chance to see them.\n\nRageRender doesn't compete with the most excellent ComicFury (who's Patreon you\nshould contribute to, as I do!) – you should continue to use ComicFury for all\nyour day-to-day artistic rage management needs. But if you find yourself making\nchanges to a site design, RageRender may be able to help you.\n\n== Getting started\n\nFirst, you need to have {Ruby}[https://www.ruby-lang.org/] and\n{Bundler}[https://bundle.io/] installed. The Jekyll site has {good guides on how\nto do that}[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/] depending on your operating\nsystem.\n\nTo set up a new site, open a terminal and type:\n\n  mkdir mycomic && cd mycomic\n  bundle init\n  bundle add jekyll\n  bundle add ragerender\n\nNow you can add comics! Add the image into an <tt>images</tt> folder:\n\n  mkdir images\n  cp 'cool comic.jpg' 'images/My first page.jpg'\n\nThe file name of the image will be the title of your comic page. And that's it,\nyou added your first comic!\n\nIf you want to add an author note, create a text file in a folder called\n<tt>_comics</tt> that has the same file name, but with a <tt>.txt</tt> extension:\n\n  mkdir _comics\n  echo \"Check out my cool comic y'all!\" > '_comics/My first page.txt'\n\nOr use HTML:\n\n  echo \"This is my <strong>first</strong> page!\" > '_comics/My first page.html'\n\nGenerate the site using:\n\n  bundle exec jekyll build\n\nOr start a local website to see it in your browser:\n\n  bundle exec jekyll serve\n  # Now visit http://localhost:4000!\n\n=== Customising your site\n\nYou'll notice a few things that might be off about your site, including that the\nwebcomic title and author name are probably not what you were expecting.\n\nYou can create a configuration file to tell RageRender the important details.\nPut something like this in your webcomic folder and call it\n<tt>_config.yml</tt>:\n\n  title: \"My awesome webcomic!\"\n  slogan: \"It's the best!\"\n  description: >\n    My epic story about how him and her\n    fell into a romantic polycule with they and them\n\n  defaults:\n  - scope:\n      path: ''\n    values:\n      author: \"John smith\"\n\n  theme: ragerender\n\nYour webcomic now has its basic information set up.\n\n=== Adding your layouts\n\nIf you want to use your own layout code, then create a <tt>_layouts</tt>\ndirectory and put the contents of each of your ComicFury layout tabs in there,\nand then put your CSS in the main folder. You should end up with a full set of\nfiles like:\n\n  _layouts\n    archive.html\n    blog-archive.html\n    blog-display.html\n    comic-page.html\n    error-page.html\n    overall.html\n    overview.html\n    search.html\n  layout.css\n\nNow when you build your site, your custom templates and styles will be used\ninstead.\n\n=== Adding blogs\n\nAdd your blogs into a folder called `_posts`:\n\n  cat _posts/2025-05-29-my-new-comic.md\n  Hey guys, welcome to my new comic! It's gonna be so sick!\n\nNote that the name of your blog post has to include the date and the title, or\nit'll be ignored.\n\n=== Customising comics and blogs\n\nYou can add {Front Matter}[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/] to set the\ndetails of your author notes and blogs manually:\n\n  ---\n  title: \"spooky comic page\"\n  date: \"2025-03-05 16:20\"\n  image: \"images/ghost.png\"\n  author: \"Jane doe\"\n  custom:\n    # use yes and no for tickbox settings\n    spooky: yes\n    # use text in quotes for short texts\n    mantra: \"live long and prosper\"\n    # use indented text for long texts\n    haiku: >\n      Testing webcomics\n      Now easier than ever\n      Thanks to RageRender\n  comments:\n    - author: \"Skippy\"\n      date: \"13 Mar 2025, 3.45 PM\"\n      comment: \"Wow this is so sick!\"\n  ---\n  Your author note still goes at the end, like this!\n\n=== Adding extra pages\n\nYou can add extra pages just by adding new HTML files to your webcomic folder.\nThe name of the file becomes the URL that it will use.\n\nPages by default won't be embedded into your 'Overall' layout. You can change\nthat and more with optional Front Matter:\n\n  ---\n  # Include this line to set the page title\n  title: \"Bonus content\"\n  # Include this line to hide the page from the navigation menu\n  hidden: yes\n  # Include this line to embed this page in the overall layout\n  layout: Overall\n  ---\n  <h1>yo check out my bonus content!</h1>\n\n=== Controlling the front page\n\nAs on ComicFury you have a few options for setting the front page of you site.\nYou control this by setting a <tt>frontpage</tt> key in your site config.\n\n- <tt>latest</tt> will display the latest comic (also the default)\n- <tt>first</tt> will display the first comic\n- <tt>chapter</tt> will display the first comic in the latest chapter\n- <tt>blog</tt> will display the list of blog posts\n- <tt>archive</tt> will display the comic archive\n- <tt>overview</tt> will display the comic overview (blogs and latest page)\n- anything else will display the extra page that has the matching\n  <tt>slug</tt> in its Front Matter\n\n=== Stuff that doesn't work\n\nHere is a probably incomplete list of things you can expect to be different\nabout your local site compared to ComicFury:\n\n- Any comments you specify in Front Matter will be present, but you can't add\n  new ones\n- Search doesn't do anything at all\n- Saving and loading your place in the comic isn't implemented\n- GET and POST variables in templates are ignored and will always be blank\n- Random numbers in templates will be random only once per site build, not once\n  per page call\n\n== Without Jekyll\n\nRageRender can also be used without Jekyll to turn ComicFury templates into\ntemplates in other languages.\n\nE.g:\n\n  gem install ragerender\n  echo \"[c:iscomicpage]<div>[f:js|v:comictitle]</div>[/]\" > template.html\n  ruby $(gem which ragerender/to_liquid) template.html\n  # {% if iscomicpage   %}<div>{{ comictitle | escape }}</div>{% endif %}\n  ruby $(gem which ragerender/to_erb) template.html\n  # <% if  iscomicpage   %><div><%= js(comictitle) %></div><% end %>\n\nYou still need to pass the correct variables to these templates; browse {this\nunofficial documentation}[https://github.com/heyeinin/comicfury-documentation]\nor RageRender::ComicDrop etc. to see which variables work on which templates.\n\n== Get help\n\nThat's not a proclamation but an invitation!
