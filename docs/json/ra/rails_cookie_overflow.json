While it is not                       advisable to store or pass around such large data in cookies, sometimes, bad actors                       can try to send large cookie payloads to your application to see if your systems are                       able to handle it. If not handled, your application would end up raising a large number                       of 500 exceptions. This gem handles the exception gracefully and responds with a                       422 Unprocessable Entity HTTP status code.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org/","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"6019b6f1dd28c48e46a1ee23bd3d70e60975d3d25d1a423f2d0095628258243c","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_cookie_overflow","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_cookie_overflow-1.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 4.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/ritikesh/rails_cookie_overflow"}
