By allowing default values, type constraints, nested schemas, and  transformations, DynamicSchema ensures that your data structures are both robust and  flexible.  \n\nNew in 2.0, DynamicSchema adds DynamicSchema::Struct which faciliates effortless definition and construction of complex object hierarchies, with optional type coersion and validation. Where DynamicSchema simplified configuration and API payload construction,  DynamicSchema::Struct simplifies construction of complex API reponses.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema"},"yanked":false,"sha":"4b83b27256718856c3fb8e2b46bea18c46e2c1940a85308b0394870dddbc2f81","spec_sha":"ffbe1b3b664d5984944fe640c3ccf39e1da2d77426a025d00850e9de0c368d0f","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/dynamicschema","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/dynamicschema-2.0.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"debug","requirements":"~> 1.9"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.13"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema"}
