By allowing default values, type constraints, nested schemas, and  transformations, DynamicSchema ensures that your data structures are both robust and  flexible.  \n\nNew in 2.0, DynamicSchema adds DynamicSchema::Struct which faciliates effortless definition and construction of complex object hierarchies, with optional type coersion and validation. Where DynamicSchema simplified configuration and API payload construction,  DynamicSchema::Struct simplifies construction of complex API reponses.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema"},"yanked":false,"sha":"e49da804e549b2a96f981e411b13a64e935e370ec65206e459adfd799251d3ea","spec_sha":"767d427d29c7fb1cbe09e24283d0539fbc017df234620ea42f7c683c000e2854","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/dynamicschema","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/dynamicschema-2.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"debug","requirements":"~> 1.9"},{"name":"minitest","requirements":"~> 6.0"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/EndlessInternational/dynamic_schema"}
