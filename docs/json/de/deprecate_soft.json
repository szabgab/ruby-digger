It wraps existing instance or\nclass methods and lets you plug in custom before/after hooks for tracking usage\nvia logging, Redis, DataDog, or any other observability tools.\n\nOnce you verify in your tracking that a method is no longer called,\nyou can remove it safely from your code base.\n\nThis is especially useful in large codebases where you want to safely remove\nlegacy methods, but first need insight into whether and where they're still\nbeing called.\n\nHooks are configured once globally and apply project-wide. Fully compatible\nwith Rails or plain Ruby applications.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft"},"yanked":false,"sha":"239388afd03ba0036514fd6e896dfbe6bec58bb653541eb48ae0a1b8212b86ab","spec_sha":"ee59a3913b4828a839ee34bcfdbe4e2e62c11a084364a8b9e7da45e4b6a5111d","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/deprecate_soft","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/deprecate_soft-1.1.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"dogstatsd-ruby","requirements":"~> 5.0"},{"name":"pry","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"redis","requirements":">= 4.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.12"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"~> 1.21"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/tilo/deprecate_soft"}
