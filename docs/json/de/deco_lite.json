Angelo, Jr.","info":"    DecoLite is a little gem that allows you to use the provided DecoLite::Model\n    class to dynamically create Decorator class objects. Use the DecoLite::Model\n    class directly, or inherit from the DecoLite::Model class to create your own\n    unique subclasses with custom functionality. DecoLite::Model\n    includes ActiveModel::Model, so validation can be applied using ActiveModel\n    validation helpers (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/HelperMethods.html)\n    you're familiar with; or, you can roll your own - just like any other ActiveModel.\n\n    DecoLite::Model allows you to consume a Ruby Hash that you supply via the\n    initializer (DecoLite::Model#new) or via the DecoLite::Model#load! method. Any\n    number of Ruby Hashes can be consumed. Your supplied Ruby Hashes are used to\n    create attr_accessor attributes (or \"fields\") on the model. Each attribute\n    created is then assigned the value from the Hash that was loaded. Again, any\n    number of hashes can be consumed using the DecoLite::Model#load! method.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"18df8da4b97675d9e5401cc2d3d10b9d648fc26c39e7a8f2435cae03eb9bf0aa","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/deco_lite","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/deco_lite-1.5.8.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/deco_lite","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/deco_lite/1.5.8","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.2, < 3.0"},{"name":"pry-byebug","requirements":">= 3.9, < 4.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 13.0, < 14.0"},{"name":"reek","requirements":">= 6.1, < 7.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":">= 3.10, < 4.0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 1.35, < 2.0"},{"name":"rubocop-performance","requirements":">= 1.14, < 2.0"},{"name":"rubocop-rspec","requirements":">= 2.12, < 3.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":">= 0.22.0, < 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"activemodel","requirements":">= 7.0.8, <= 7.12.0"},{"name":"activesupport","requirements":">= 7.0.8, <= 7.12.0"},{"name":"immutable_struct_ex","requirements":">= 1.0, < 2.0"},{"name":"mad_flatter","requirements":">= 3.0, < 4.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/gangelo/deco_lite"}
