It provides support for access tokens and refresh tokens, which allow you to authenticate API requests and keep the user's session active for a longer period of time on the client side. It can be installed by adding the gem to your Gemfile, running migrations, and adding the :api module to your devise model. The gem is fully configurable, allowing you to set things like token expiration times and token generators.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api"},"yanked":false,"sha":"90b10c61b03cb93661b5ab71d9e3ae3aac7d76503e59f119af3a8f01ae28742c","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/devise-api","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/devise-api-0.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"devise","requirements":">= 4.7.2"},{"name":"dry-configurable","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.1"},{"name":"dry-initializer","requirements":">= 3.1.1"},{"name":"dry-monads","requirements":">= 1.6.0"},{"name":"dry-types","requirements":">= 1.7.0"},{"name":"rails","requirements":">= 6.0.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/nejdetkadir/devise-api"}
