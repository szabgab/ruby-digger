Something like (from the example):\n\n  > mkdir demake\n  > echo \"hello string\" > demake/applications\n  > echo \"goodbye string\" >> demake/applications\n  > demake > Makefile\n\n  For customization, optionally include (see example):\n  demake/settings.rb, demake/test-target.rb, demake/install-target.rb\n\n  The output of the command by itself is a (GNU style) Makefile:\n\n  > demake > Makefile\n\n  You can also clone from git for a more complete example:\n\n  > git clone https://github.com/MinaswanNakamoto/demake.git\n  > chmod +x demake/bin/demake\n  > cd demake\n  > bin/demake example\n  > cd example ; make ; make build ; make test\n\n  If you have an existing C application and you want to generate a Makefile for it,\n  you might try the gen_application shell script.\n\n  > ./gen_application myapp\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"f9a99f1706080b4e6032336f8b7e91de81c8fb462c1490b3b7fa68754bdc3ee0","spec_sha":"bc483cd99215a2ea2c5a1e63a5b6d9de9ca274cc899ec6aeec040a5b34d591a6","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/demake","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/demake-0.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/MinaswanNakamoto/demake","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/demake/0.1.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"pipetext","requirements":"~> 0.1, >= 0.1.3"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/MinaswanNakamoto/demake"}
