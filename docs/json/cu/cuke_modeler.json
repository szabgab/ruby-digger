It does this by providing an abstraction layer on top of the Abstract Syntax Tree that the 'cucumber-gherkin' gem generates when parsing features, as well as providing models for feature files and directories in order to be able to have a fully traversable model tree of a test suite's structure. These models can then be analyzed or manipulated more easily than the underlying AST layer.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cuke_modeler","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"ade8e0795df9d9c55f174125f9f2aa51ae851cd782d25049ddf1ef7d07b04244","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cuke_modeler","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cuke_modeler-3.19.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cuke_modeler","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":"< 3.0"},{"name":"childprocess","requirements":"< 5.0"},{"name":"cucumber","requirements":">= 4.0.0, < 8.0.0"},{"name":"ffi","requirements":"< 2.0"},{"name":"rainbow","requirements":"< 4.0.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"< 14.0.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"< 2.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":"< 1.0"},{"name":"simplecov-lcov","requirements":"< 1.0"},{"name":"test-unit","requirements":"< 4.0.0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":"< 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"cucumber-gherkin","requirements":"< 27.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler"}
