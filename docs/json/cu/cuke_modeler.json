It does this by providing an abstraction layer on top of the Abstract Syntax Tree that the 'cucumber-gherkin' gem generates when parsing features, as well as providing models for feature files and directories in order to be able to have a fully traversable model tree of a test suite's structure. These models can then be analyzed or manipulated more easily than the underlying AST layer.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cuke_modeler","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"ea10f286556e8655db2fae2c0d09c111ee241fb10d71d8fa1cfa812af910434b","spec_sha":"76e3671f404f2f880f139b8d5ae800998943bad35f221dda491db64811f18e9c","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cuke_modeler","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/cuke_modeler-3.27.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cuke_modeler","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"base64","requirements":"< 1.0"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":"< 5.0"},{"name":"childprocess","requirements":"< 6.0"},{"name":"cucumber","requirements":">= 2.2.0, < 11.0.0"},{"name":"rainbow","requirements":"< 4.0.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"< 14.0.0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":"< 2.0"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":"< 1.0"},{"name":"simplecov-lcov","requirements":"< 1.0"},{"name":"test-unit","requirements":"< 4.0.0"},{"name":"yard","requirements":"< 1.0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"cucumber-gherkin","requirements":"< 38.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler"}
