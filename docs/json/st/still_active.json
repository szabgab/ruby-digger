Ruby version freshness with EOL detection. Handles rubygems, git, path, and GitHub Packages sources. Outputs coloured terminal tables, markdown, or JSON. CI quality gates with --fail-if-critical, --fail-if-warning, --fail-if-vulnerable, --fail-if-outdated, and --ignore. A comprehensive alternative to running bundle outdated, bundler-audit, and libyear-bundler separately.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"1e6e88ade1b22ac1801c81c5f9cc22914d711b8190104797df188606f1968447","spec_sha":"0280775b38a9aced38c19bd459f9852cceb5a0bf5e8712ce32bfbaccf69e03a7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/still_active","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/still_active-1.2.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"debug","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"faker","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop-performance","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop-rspec","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rubocop-shopify","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"async","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 2.0"},{"name":"faraday-retry","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"gems","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"octokit","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active"}
