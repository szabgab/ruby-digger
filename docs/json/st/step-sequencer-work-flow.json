Inspired by \n the functionality of musical sequencers, StepSequencer \n allows developers to chain together a series of steps \n that are executed in order, with the capability to halt\n  the sequence based on custom conditions. This gem is \n  particularly useful for scenarios where a set of tasks \n  must be performed in a specific sequence, and where \n  each task might depend on the outcome of the previous \n  one.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"3b024ce4c63638fffd23b57448edf79a2e39baad78108aabcf9dd00ac17343b2","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/step-sequencer-work-flow","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/step-sequencer-work-flow-0.2.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/joegiralt/step-sequencer","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/step-sequencer-work-flow/0.2.0","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"circleci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/joegiralt/step-sequencer"}
