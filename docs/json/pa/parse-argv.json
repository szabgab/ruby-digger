It works sort of the other way around than OptParse,\nwhere you write a lot of code to get a command line parser and generated\nhelp text. ParseArgv simply takes your help text and parses the command\nline and presents you the results.\n\nYou can use ParseArgv for simpler programs just as well as for CLI with\nmulti-level sub-commands (git-like commands). ParseArgv is easy to use,\nfast and also helps you convert the data types of command line arguments.\n","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"metadata":{"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv","documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/parse-argv"},"yanked":false,"sha":"f3f4b7f54ca2574b6dfc08dc2b8b9c0eb47c6f0153542c5e27ea437155ac2dc7","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/parse-argv","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/parse-argv-0.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://rubydoc.info/gems/parse-argv","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv/issues","changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/mblumtritt/parse-argv"}
