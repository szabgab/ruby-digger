It provides a generator that helps scaffold the necessary configuration, routes, models, and controllers required to integrate PayFast seamlessly.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n```bash\n    bundle add payfast\n```\nOr install it yourseld as:\n\n\n```bash\n    gem install payfast\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n  rails generate payfast:install\n```\n\n## This generator will perform the following actions:\n\n    insert  config/routes.rb\n    create  app/controllers/carts_controller.rb\n    create  app/views/carts/index.html.erb\n    create  app/views/carts/make_payment.html.erb\n    create  app/helpers/carts_helper.rb\n    create  db/migrate/20230824105530_create_carts.rb\n    create  config/payfast.yml\n    create  app/models/cart.rb\n    insert  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb\n    insert  config/environments/development.rb\n\n\n\n## Additional configuration\n\nSetup payfast credentials for your environment\n\n    rails EDITOR=\"code --wait\" bin/rails credentials:edit\n  \n  This will allow you to securely edit and store your credentials. once you save and exit the file, the credentials will be encrypted and can only be accessed withe rails master key.\n\n    payfast: \n      merchant_id: {your_merchant_id}\n      merchant_key: {your_merchant_key}\n      passphrase:  {{your_passphrase}}\n\n## Update your `payfast.yml` config file\n- setup the credentials to be use by the rails app\n- uncomment `Rails.application.credentials.payfast.merchant_id ` and wrap it in erb tags as instructed in the comments.\n\n\n## Templates\n Update the `make_payment.html.erb` as instructed in the file. it should look like so:\n\n```js\n<script>\n// set the uuid to  uuid = @cart.payment_uid. surround @carts.payment_uid with erb tags\nconst uuid = `<%= @cart.payment_uuid %>`\nwindow.payfast_do_onsite_payment({uuid}, function (result) {\n  if (result === true) {\n    // redirect success_path(@cart)\n    window.location.href = `<%= success_cart_path(@cart) %>`\n  }\n  else {\n    // Redirect to  failure_path(@cart)\n    window.location.href = `<%= failure_cart_path(@cart) %>`\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n## Testing\n- payfast api allows only SSL communication from your server. inorder to test locally. you will have to use a tunneling service that allows you to expose your local development server to the internet. \n\nyour rails development config has was modified by the generator to allow ngrok hosts to hit your rails server\n\n```ruby\n config.hosts << /[a-z0-9-]+\\.ngrok-free\\.app/\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to our project!
