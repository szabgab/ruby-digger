You would use either plugin / gem if you\n    wished that when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it\n    didn't actually destroy it, but just \"hid\" the record. Paranoia does this\n    by setting a deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record,\n    and hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records\n    which do not have a deleted_at field.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"cdb50c4c5c66f61fd1354f26371a8f0ca6d60156215bebffff42e135c495d083","spec_sha":"968b0ef03d0759c6bfcaa358cf8a692da35dc1793e03b0a27f12090da5846315","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/paranoia","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/paranoia-3.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/paranoia/3.0.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 1.0.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"activerecord","requirements":">= 6, < 8.1"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia"}
