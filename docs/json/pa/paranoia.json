You would use either plugin / gem if you\n    wished that when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it\n    didn't actually destroy it, but just \"hid\" the record. Paranoia does this\n    by setting a deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record,\n    and hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records\n    which do not have a deleted_at field.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"e7626868a603442311d4bb5934615f59b912f9b4afd3522f6904a019dae9a3a1","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/paranoia","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/paranoia-2.6.3.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/paranoia/2.6.3","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 1.0.0"},{"name":"rake","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[{"name":"activerecord","requirements":">= 5.1, < 7.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia"}
