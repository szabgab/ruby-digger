It further helps by\nproviding additional mechanisms to make specifying subsets easier\nwith path subtraction and allowing for command-line arguments to be\nsaved in a file.\n\nNOTE: this is NOT an options processor. It is a path processor\n(basically everything else besides options). It does provide a\nmechanism for pre-filtering cmdline options, but not with the intent\nof actually processing them in PathExpander. Use OptionParser to\ndeal with options either before or after passing ARGV through\nPathExpander.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander"},"yanked":false,"sha":"2de201164bff4719cc4d0b3767286e9977cc832a59c4d70abab571ec86cb41e4","spec_sha":"30afbf54705cea455b933c8fbcee5b306fab0381ec0822baad1ba371e3e5af83","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/path_expander","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/path_expander-2.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.5"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 6.0, < 8"},{"name":"simplecov","requirements":"~> 0.21"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander"}
