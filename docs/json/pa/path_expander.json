It further helps by\nproviding additional mechanisms to make specifying subsets easier\nwith path subtraction and allowing for command-line arguments to be\nsaved in a file.\n\nNOTE: this is NOT an options processor. It is a path processor\n(basically everything else besides options). It does provide a\nmechanism for pre-filtering cmdline options, but not with the intent\nof actually processing them in PathExpander. Use OptionParser to\ndeal with options either before or after passing ARGV through\nPathExpander.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander"},"yanked":false,"sha":"bea16440dea5a770b9765312c8037931cc576f4f2872d71133a3e480028f9f67","spec_sha":"c505f41b325d97db049a7486e6d20b6d72bbf087e670d6dda7d87873be4ebbed","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/path_expander","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/path_expander-1.1.3.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"hoe","requirements":"~> 4.2"},{"name":"rdoc","requirements":">= 4.0, < 7"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/seattlerb/path_expander"}
