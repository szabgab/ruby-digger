It allows you to settle subjective comparisons with a `ActibeGenie::Comparator` module that stages a political debate, get accurate scores from an AI jury using `ActiveGenie::Scorer`, and rank large datasets using `ActiveGenie::Ranker`'s tournament-style system.\nThis reliability is built on three core pillars:\n- Custom Benchmarking: Testing for consistency with every new version and model update.\n- Reasoning Prompting: Utilizing human reasoning techniques (like debate and jury review) to control a model's reasoning.\n- Overfitting Prompts: Highly specialized, and potentially model-specific, prompt for each module's purpose.\n","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/issues","documentation_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/wiki","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"591cdfeb88a4d835e0bf719bfe39ab88d0762f79ed2e4aa78b85674deded26f3","spec_sha":"77845da8c9f70ff3a40b46c4e19d8fbeb36bff9def23777bc8357570ee51cfcf","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/active_genie","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/active_genie-0.30.8.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/wiki","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"async","requirements":"~> 2.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie"}
