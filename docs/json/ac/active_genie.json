Just like Lodash or ActiveStorage, ActiveGenie brings a set of Modules reach real value fast and reliable.\nActiveGenie is backed by a custom benchmarking system that ensures consistent quality and performance across different models and providers in every release.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Add to your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'active_genie'\n```\n\n2. Install the gem:\n```shell\nbundle install\n```\n\n3. Generate the configuration:\n```shell\necho \"ActiveGenie.load_tasks\" >> Rakefile\nrails g active_genie:install\n```\n\n4. Configure your credentials in `config/initializers/active_genie.rb`:\n```ruby\nActiveGenie.configure do |config|\n  config.openai.api_key = ENV['OPENAI_API_KEY']\nend\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Data Extractor\n\nExtract structured data from text using AI-powered analysis, handling informal language and complex expressions.\n\n```ruby\ntext = \"Nike Air Max 90 - Size 42 - $199.99\"\nschema = {\n  brand: { \n    type: 'string',\n    enum: [\"Nike\", \"Adidas\", \"Puma\"]\n  },\n  price: { \n    type: 'number',\n    minimum: 0\n  },\n  size: {\n    type: 'number',\n    minimum: 35,\n    maximum: 46\n  }\n}\n\nresult = ActiveGenie::DataExtractor.call(\n  text,\n  schema,\n  config: { provider: :openai, model: 'gpt-4o-mini' } # optional\n)\n# => { \n#      brand: \"Nike\", \n#      brand_explanation: \"Brand name found at start of text\",\n#      price: 199.99,\n#      price_explanation: \"Price found in USD format at end\",\n#      size: 42,\n#      size_explanation: \"Size explicitly stated in the middle\"\n#    }\n```\n\n*Recommended model*: `gpt-4o-mini`\n\nFeatures:\n- Structured data extraction with type validation\n- Schema-based extraction with custom constraints\n- Informal text analysis (litotes, hedging)\n- Detailed explanations for extracted values\n\nSee the [Data Extractor README](lib/active_genie/data_extractor/README.md) for informal text processing, advanced schemas, and detailed interface documentation.\n\n### Scoring\nText evaluation system that provides detailed scoring and feedback using multiple expert reviewers. Get balanced scoring through AI-powered expert reviewers that automatically adapt to your content.\n\n```ruby\ntext = \"The code implements a binary search algorithm with O(log n) complexity\"\ncriteria = \"Evaluate technical accuracy and clarity\"\n\nresult = ActiveGenie::Scoring.basic(\n  text,\n  criteria,\n  config: { provider: :anthropic, model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022' } # optional\n)\n# => {\n#      algorithm_expert_score: 95,\n#      algorithm_expert_reasoning: \"Accurately describes binary search and its complexity\",\n#      technical_writer_score: 90,\n#      technical_writer_reasoning: \"Clear and concise explanation of the algorithm\",\n#      final_score: 92.5\n#    }\n```\n\n*Recommended model*: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`\n\nFeatures:\n- Multi-reviewer evaluation with automatic expert selection\n- Detailed feedback with scoring reasoning\n- Customizable reviewer weights\n- Flexible evaluation criteria\n\nSee the [Scoring README](lib/active_genie/scoring/README.md) for advanced usage, custom reviewers, and detailed interface documentation.\n\n### Battle\nAI-powered battle evaluation system that determines winners between two players based on specified criteria.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'active_genie'\n\nplayer_1 = \"Implementation uses dependency injection for better testability\"\nplayer_2 = \"Code has high test coverage but tightly coupled components\"\ncriteria = \"Evaluate code quality and maintainability\"\n\nresult = ActiveGenie::Battle.call(\n  player_1,\n  player_2,\n  criteria,\n  config: { provider: :google, model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-lite' } # optional\n)\n# => {\n#      winner_player: \"Implementation uses dependency injection for better testability\",\n#      reasoning: \"Player 1 implementation demonstrates better maintainability through dependency injection, \n#                 which allows for easier testing and component replacement. While Player 2 has good test coverage, \n#                 the tight coupling makes the code harder to maintain and modify.\",\n#      what_could_be_changed_to_avoid_draw: \"Focus on specific architectural patterns and design principles\"\n#    }\n```\n\n*Recommended model*: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`\n\nFeatures:\n- Multi-reviewer evaluation with automatic expert selection\n- Detailed feedback with scoring reasoning\n- Customizable reviewer weights\n- Flexible evaluation criteria\n\nSee the [Battle README](lib/active_genie/battle/README.md) for advanced usage, custom reviewers, and detailed interface documentation.\n\n### Ranking\nThe Ranking module provides competitive ranking through multi-stage evaluation:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'active_genie'\n\nplayers = ['REST API', 'GraphQL API', 'SOAP API', 'gRPC API', 'Websocket API']\ncriteria = \"Best one to be used into a high changing environment\"\n\nresult = ActiveGenie::Ranking.call(\n  players,\n  criteria,\n  config: { provider: :google, model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-lite' } # optional\n)\n# => {\n#      winner_player: \"gRPC API\",\n#      reasoning: \"gRPC API is the best one to be used into a high changing environment\",\n#    }\n```\n\n*Recommended model*: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`\n\n- **Multi-phase ranking system** combining expert scoring and ELO algorithms\n- **Automatic elimination** of inconsistent performers using statistical analysis\n- **Dynamic ranking adjustments** based on simulated pairwise battles, from bottom to top\n\nSee the [Ranking README](lib/active_genie/ranking/README.md) for implementation details, configuration, and advanced ranking strategies.\n\n### Text Summarizer (Future)\n### Categorizer (Future)\n### Language detector (Future)\n### Translator (Future)\n### Sentiment analyzer (Future)\n\n## Benchmarking 🧪\n\nActiveGenie includes a comprehensive benchmarking system to ensure consistent, high-quality outputs across different LLM models and providers.\n\n```ruby\n# Run all benchmarks\nbundle exec rake active_genie:benchmark\n\n# Run benchmarks for a specific module\nbundle exec rake active_genie:benchmark[data_extractor]\n```\n\n### Latest Results\n\n| Model | Overall Precision |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 | 92.25% |\n| gemini-2.0-flash-lite | 84.25% |\n| gpt-4o-mini | 62.75% |\n| deepseek-chat | 57.25% |\n\nSee the [Benchmark README](benchmark/README.md) for detailed results, methodology, and how to contribute to our test suite.\n\n## Configuration\n\n| Config | Description | Default |\n|--------|-------------|---------|\n| `provider` | LLM provider (openai, anthropic, etc) | `nil` |\n| `model` | Model to use | `nil` |\n| `api_key` | Provider API key | `nil` |\n| `timeout` | Request timeout in seconds | `5` |\n| `max_retries` | Maximum retry attempts | `3` |\n\n> **Note:** Each module can append its own set of configuration, see the individual module documentation for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
