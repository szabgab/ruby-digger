This can be used as a replacement for mysqldump or pg_dump,\nbut it only supports features found in ActiveRecord-based (Rails, etc.) apps.\nUsers, permissions, schemas, triggers, and other advanced database features are not supported by design.\nAny database that has an ActiveRecord adapter should work.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{},"yanked":false,"sha":"922ebf7d59015751990c92911887351f69ac0108b4b28cb42ce27a5eb83c1969","spec_sha":"f01e8a0da82f4bc108d03d514c7597d9309b0bd11a6f8d83ca5b86aaa3197cca","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord_dumper","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord_dumper-0.9.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/spijet/activerecord_dumper","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/activerecord_dumper/0.9.1","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":null,"bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"bundler","requirements":">= 1.14"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.13"},{"name":"sqlite3","requirements":">= 2.1"}],"runtime":[{"name":"activerecord","requirements":">= 3.2.22, < 8.2"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"travis_ci":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/spijet/activerecord_dumper"}
