However, sometimes we need to automatically generate multiple similar classes, either because of poor design or because of external necessities. For example, to define a GraphQL schema with GraphQL Ruby (https://graphql-ruby.org/) we need to define a distinct class for each type. Since GraphQL is statically type checked but doesn't provide generics, if we need a set of similar but distinct types we're left to define them one by one.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class"},"yanked":false,"sha":"d5d730e0c3fe2a6d2ed8acd6e137e947cedf384d3427c20296498b5e86a9ff19","spec_sha":"b114200c82ffdb2b35370748c5830998d3c379dfd8c5dc731fcc380e994922cb","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/template_class","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/template_class-1.3.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"activesupport","requirements":">= 0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/moku-io/template_class"}
