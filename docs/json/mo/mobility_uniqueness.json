It allows you to ensure that a given attribute, \n    such as `name` in different locales, is unique within the specified locale. \n\n    By using this validator, you can enforce uniqueness for translations without needing to write \n    complex custom validation code in your Rails models. The gem works seamlessly with Mobility’s \n    `KeyValue` backend to query translations and check for duplicates.\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"59faf3b0689e979229143dba615cf37ce7b5dd2c54c5cc6b398a8108477da120","spec_sha":"7c87dde748421e4bad127685f8ec981181dac367678a29bd98ac7ce8cabfebc4","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mobility_uniqueness","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/mobility_uniqueness-0.1.2.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"activerecord","requirements":"~> 7.2, >= 7.2.2"},{"name":"mobility","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":">= 0"},{"name":"sqlite3","requirements":">= 0"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/egemen-dev/mobility_uniqueness"}
