It shows exactly what gems will be updated with color output that calls attention to significant semver changes. Bundleup will also let you know when a version \"pin\" in your Gemfile is preventing an update. Bundleup is a standalone tool that leverages standard Bundler output and does not patch code or use Bundler internals.","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup/releases","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"cad5ac49d00c62bd3e81f9563fd6476cb0b9c5df526277986985b4e51c84ead3","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/bundleup","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/bundleup-2.3.0.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup/releases","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup"}
