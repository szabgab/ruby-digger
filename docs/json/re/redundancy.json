It then writes the filtered output back to the appropriate file. The source code works better as an Apple Shortcut, as there is a significant delay running redundancy when Terminal is open (several closings and reopenings).","licenses":["Unlicense"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nausicaan/redundancy","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nausicaan/redundancy"},"yanked":false,"sha":"6bef364089fb300f8dbd448860faf741ce7dfdf4758f28b764fa9b185153b3b5","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/redundancy","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/redundancy-0.0.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/nausicaan/redundancy","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/nausicaan/redundancy","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":null,"funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/nausicaan/redundancy"}
