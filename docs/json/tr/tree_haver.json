Boling","info":"🌴 TreeHaver is a cross-Ruby adapter for the tree-sitter parsing library that works seamlessly across MRI Ruby, JRuby, and TruffleRuby. It provides a unified API for parsing source code using tree-sitter grammars, regardless of your Ruby implementation. Like Faraday for HTTP or multi_json for JSON, TreeHaver lets you write once and run anywhere with automatic backend selection (MRI C extensions, Rust extensions, FFI, or Java).","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"news_uri":"https://www.railsbling.com/tags/tree_haver","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/wiki","discord_uri":"https://discord.gg/3qme4XHNKN","funding_uri":"https://github.com/sponsors/pboling","homepage_uri":"https://tree-haver.galtzo.com/","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/blob/v3.2.5/CHANGELOG.md","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/issues","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/tree/v3.2.5","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tree_haver/3.2.5","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"be676b367fd4804db09e22b20f87a17736eeb0a0aa815ea1fa56430bb4862e36","spec_sha":"f82ee6006dc467456a09b8cb3d0da3ae72206932437c91bc68858501ffea647e","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/tree_haver","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/tree_haver-3.2.5.gem","homepage_uri":"https://tree-haver.galtzo.com/","wiki_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/wiki","documentation_uri":"https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tree_haver/3.2.5","mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/tree/v3.2.5","bug_tracker_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/issues","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/blob/v3.2.5/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":"https://github.com/sponsors/pboling","dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"appraisal2","requirements":"~> 3.0"},{"name":"bundler-audit","requirements":"~> 0.9.3"},{"name":"gitmoji-regex","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.3"},{"name":"kettle-dev","requirements":"~> 1.2"},{"name":"kettle-soup-cover","requirements":"~> 1.1, >= 1.1.1"},{"name":"kettle-test","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.6"},{"name":"rake","requirements":"~> 13.0"},{"name":"require_bench","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.4"},{"name":"ruby-progressbar","requirements":"~> 1.13"},{"name":"stone_checksums","requirements":"~> 1.0, >= 1.0.3"}],"runtime":[{"name":"version_gem","requirements":"~> 1.1, >= 1.1.9"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_error":"ERROR","vcs_uri":"https://github.com/kettle-rb/tree_haver/tree/v3.2.5"}
