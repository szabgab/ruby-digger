It works out of the box with Cloudflare headers if your Rails app is behind it; or you can also use MaxMind databases (BYOK). The gem offers a clean API for Rails applications to fetch country, city, emoji flag, region, continent, postal code, latitude, longitude and other GeoIP information for any IP address. Supports Cloudflare headers, and MaxMind GeoLite2 databases (offline capable).","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org","rubygems_mfa_required":"true"},"yanked":false,"sha":"85bb8f193d6e7681450a469af6915d1886da40cadef1a67e0a35dc4259913980","spec_sha":"52c1b44078c1ac1d45914d76971a6adc45fbe08d31745e36a01dd4f00b1a0a89","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/trackdown","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/trackdown-0.3.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[],"runtime":[{"name":"countries","requirements":"~> 7.0"}]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":1,"github_actions":1,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown"}
