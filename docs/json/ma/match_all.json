This gem provides the #match_all method, returns all instances\nof a pattern match in a String as an array.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n# Given the test string:\nstring = \"My cat is asleep on the couch. Now the cat is playing.\"\n\n# #match only returns the first match:\n\nstring.match(/cat/)\n=> #<MatchData \"cat\">\n\n# However, I've found I often want to match _all_ instances of the pattern, and\n# then e.g. iterate through them and do something with them. #match_all does that:\n\nstring.match_all(/cat/)\n=> [\n     [0] #<MatchData \"cat\">,\n     [1] #<MatchData \"cat\">\n   ]\n\nThis is especially useful if, e.g. you want to interrogate the matches to find\nout their starting/ending indexes within the string, etc\n","licenses":["MIT"],"metadata":{"homepage_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all","changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all","allowed_push_host":"https://rubygems.org"},"yanked":false,"sha":"fd67b22f9b40e714379b05e4b47469856c0dd7908c0498a1b4083dd6a2d2bd87","project_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/match_all","gem_uri":"https://rubygems.org/gems/match_all-0.1.1.gem","homepage_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all","wiki_uri":null,"documentation_uri":null,"mailing_list_uri":null,"source_code_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all","bug_tracker_uri":null,"changelog_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","funding_uri":null,"dependencies":{"development":[{"name":"pry","requirements":"~> 0.13.1"},{"name":"rspec","requirements":"~> 3.2"}],"runtime":[]}},"vcs_name":"GitHub","ci":null,"vcs_uri":"https://github.com/jeffdlange/match_all"}
